## PRIMARY AND SECONDARY COLORS

All colors in this "color chart" are made from
the primary colors, yellow, red and blue.




## SECONDARY AND TERTIARY COLORS

Overlapping plates on this sheet are printed
in full color. Tints are avoided in order to show
secondary and tertiary colors in full strength.




To lighten secondary or tertiary colors add more
of the lightest color of the combination. For
example, if a lighter shade of primary green is
more desirable, use more yellow; to deepen, add
blue; to use as a tint, add white.




The above plates illustrate the primary and
secondary colors broken up with light.

## WHAT IS COLOR?

Color is an effect caused by the reflection of cer-
tain rays of light. In order to understand this statement, it is necessary that we know what light is. Science teaches us that light is a form of intense vibration which reaches the earth direct from the sun. These vibrations affect certain nerves of the retina of the eye, causing the sensa-
tion known as color.

In the study of color, or in practice, it is neces-
sary that we have a standard. The standard col-
ors are those seen in the spectrum or in the rain-
bow. These colors are selected as standard colors
because they are the true colors as reflected by
pure light and they never change.

In dealing with pigments the primary colors are
yellow, red and blue. They are called primary
colors because all other colors are produced from
them, and because they can not be produced by
mixing other colors. In other words, they are,
the original colors from which all other colors are
produced.

## WARM AND COLD COLORS
Cold and warm colors: Red warm, blue cold,
yellow bright. White, which is also a cold color
when added to black makes a cold gray, Yellow
added to red forms a warm orange.



## MEANING OF COLORS

White is said to mean purity; blue, fidelity or
truth; red, love or sacrifice; green, envy; pink,
modesty; violet, innocence; yellow, jealousy;
black, sorrow or distress, and lavender, passion.

## ART OF COLOR MIXING

Mixing colors is an art in itself. With a com-
bination of the chief colors — red, yellow, blue
(and black and white), thousands of shades ant
hues may be produced.

Mixed in various proportions, either in twos, 01
all three together, these three colors produce
every hue in nature or in art, every tint that is
physically possible.

The primary colors are yellow, red and blue.

The secondary colors are orange, violet and
green.

The tertiary colors are citron, russet and olive.

The secondary colors are made as follows: Yel-
low and red make orange, red and blue make vio-
let, yellow and blue make green.

The tertiary colors are mixed from the second-
ary colors as follows: Orange and violet make
russet, violet and green make olive, orange and
green make citron.

Black, white and gray are natural tones in
which no color is apparent: White pales but does
not brighten any color. Yellow is the brighten-
ing color and always stands out strong and ad-
vancing; to deepen a color use its complementary
color; to deepen yellow add purple; to deepen red
add blue; to deepen blue add burnt sienna, then
you will have purity of color*



## THE TWO EXTREMES OP WARM AND COLD

Vermilion or any other red of orange hue
(warm). Bluish blue (cold). These two colors
mixed together in certain proportions form light
brown, dark brown, red brown, neutral brown and
scarlet red. Purple made from this combination
is inferior.



## COLOR BLINDNESS

Today, color-blindness is a serious difficulty in
the way of a person earning a living. A genera-
tion or so ago, it was considered a matter of small
importance. Many persons, suffering from the
disease, went through life without knowing they
were afflicted. The only persons, as a class, who
were greatly affected by the problem were rail-
road men, who had to take tests for the distinc-
tion of colors.

Today, with the common use of automobiles
and the rapidly growing use of colored lights for
signs and signals, color-blindness becomes an im-
portant matter.

The defect is hereditary and much more com-
mon in men than in women. A woman may have
normal eyesight herself and yet transmit the
color-blindness to her children. This is because
it is what the geneticist calls a recessive char-
acter. A man may have a color-blind father and
still not transmit the defect. But a color-blind
woman, married to a color-blinded man, trans-
mits the defect to all offsprings, both sons and
daughters.

## ALTERING COLOR
To brighten color, add yellow; to give it
warmth, add red. To brighten and warm, add or-
ange. To deepen and cool, add blue. To cool and
lighten, add green; to deepen and warm, add
purple.



Ultramarine blue contains sulphur and will
tarnish with admixtures of pigment containing
lead. Substitute zinc white.



## PIGMENT

Pigment is any color preparation used by paint-
ers, printing pressmen, etc. Coloring matter is
found in pigment cells of plants, tissues of ani-
mals and fish; in mineral form found in the earth,
from coal, vegetables, etc.

Pigments may be divided into two classes, the
organic and the inorganic. Organic pigments are
compounds of carbon and the inorganic all other
pigments.

Paints and printers' inks are made from the
same pigments; the difference is in the mordant.
It all depends on the nature of the object to be
colored. The mordant is the fixer which holds
the pigment.

The selection of color material should be care-
fuly made. Purchase from reliable dealers an
assortment of reds, blues and yellows, some black
and white.



## NATURE'S COLOR CHART OF HARMONIOUS COMBINATIONS

Nature has given us a wonderful color chart,
of harmonious colors mingled together.

Flowers furnish countless color combinations
which are perfect in every detail. Colors rang-
ing from soft, delicate tints to deep, rich solids,
are found in great variety.

Observe also the birds, whose plumage range
from the most gorgeous to the so-called jet black
raven or black birds; even they when viewed in
sun or strong light reveal a picture of dazzling
beauty. Beautiful tones and semi-tones of pur-
ple, green and blue blending perfectly with the
black.

It is unnecessary to mention in detail, the
fields, woods and forest, the seas, the lofty, state-
ly mountain peaks of somber hues silhouetted
against an azure sky or viewed in the setting sun.

6



## COLOR HARMONY
The secret of harmony is equal value, comple-
mentary colors are the color or colors which,
with any color or colors mentioned, make the
three primary colors, which constitute white
light. For example if given color is a primary,
its complementary color is composed of the other
two primary colors; the complementary color of
blue is orange, red and yellow. And if given
color be a secondary, its complementary color is
the remaining color. Thus the complementary
color of green, blue and yellow is red.

It is well to bear in mind whether the sub-
ject to be treated is a landscape scene, color de-
sign, form to be printed in colors, sign or house
painting that equal value of colors is the correct
way.

Any subject that has been ill treated with too
much red, or colors which do not harmonize, form
a combination that irritates.

When colors are correctly used the effect is
soothing. Remember that red is the most irrita-
ting color and a little will balance well with a
large amount of other colors.

The object to be painted or printed has a lot
to do with the selection of colors. It is well
to study the subject carefully.

Printing pressmen have their problems. When
printing on white material which is a neutral
color he does not encounter the obstacles as when
printing colored inks on colored material.

All fine pictorial color printing is executed on
white material, this being the only way to get
pure coloring, as it is generally printed with
transparent ink.



## MIXING TINTS

Paints, Inks, Etc.

Tint mixing is both interesting and profitable,
but in order to obtain the best results, first-class
materials are very essential. Great care should
be exercised in the selection of this material, as
the product of one manufacturer often varies, as
to shade with that of another manufacture, there-
fore it is well for the color mixer to make it a
rule, never to select colors promiscuously.

With the following colors at hand all known
colors may be obtained. Lemon yellow, which is
of greenish hue; yellow of orange hue; red with
orange hue; red which has a bluish cast. Blue
with a reddish tone, also blue with a leaning to-
ward green. A liberal supply of white and some
black which does not contain blue.

To produce a pure tint you must first produce
a pure base of the primary colors. White, which
is a neutral color, does not alter the original hue,
it merely pales. In making pure greens from
yellow and blue, the yellow and blue should con-
tain none of the primary color red; use a green-
ish yellow and greenish blue. For pure orange
use a yellow and red which contain none of the
primary blue; the yellow must be of reddish hue,
the red of yellowish cast. Pure violets are made
with bluish reds and reddish blues. The red and
blue should not contain any of the primary; color
yellow.

Gray tint is white with black in various pro-
portions. Neutral gray must be mixed from a
black which is unadulterated with a mixture of
blue. To warm, add a touch of red; to cool, add a
small amount of blue. The object in making
neutral gray as above mentioned is to make pos-

8



sible a true blending with other colors. For ex-
ample, a bluish gray is desired, add blue to neu-
tral gray until the exact shade is acquired; for
orange gray add a touch of orange, etc, etc.

Primary colors are made neutral by admixture,
a medium or neutral yellow is obtained by mixing
lemon yellow with orange yellow. The greenish
tinge of lemon yellow is absorbed by the reddish
tinge of orange yellow. Neutral red and blue is
made in the same manner; likewise the blues.

As has been previously mentioned, white when
added for tinting purposes does not alter the
hues. For example, the result of adding white
in any quantity to purplish red is a purplish pink
tint, the purple hue will remain.

When warm tints are desired use a warm base.
For warm pink select a red of orange hue, a cool
pink from bluish red, a neutral pink must be
made from a neutral base which is the resultof
adding primary bluish red and primary yellowish
red.



## TO MATCH SPECIAL COLORS

In mixing special colors or shades for large
jobs, first mix a small quantity, write down exact
proportions either by weight or volume, keep
a record for future reference.

If you have failed to keep a record and have a
small quantity on hand and wish to duplicate it
exactly, put a small amount on a piece of white
paper and after mixing a little dribble or let it
string across the original sample you can get a
perfect match. Still another way; brush a small
quantity on a piece of tranparent glass, add a
like amount of the paint you mix beside it and
hold to the light.

To match a specimen in printing ink; mix the
color (small quantity), ink up press, pull an im-
pression then with your make ready knife cut
a small hole (any shape) in the most solid part
of print, lay this over a solid part of sample.

## ORIGIN AND DEFINITION OF COLORS.

Alumina — One of the earths containing alum-
inum.



Aureolin Yellow — A transparent, delicate me-
dium yellow. Is a nitrate of cobalt.



Amber — A mineralized pale yellow, and some-
times reddish or brownish resin of extinct pine
trees.



Ambergris- — A morbid secretion of the sperma-
ceti whale of solid opaque ash color.



Aniline — A substance obtained from indigo and
benzole, a product of coal tar.

Amaranth — The unfading flower a color in-
clined to purple.



Antwerp Blue — A transparent color lighter
than prussian blue; splendid to mix with yellow
for greens and tints.



Bronze Blues — Made by mixtures of xerro and
ferricyanides of iron and potassium or sodium.
Bronze blue, so called for its bronzy effect. It is
an opaque, deep blue, used almost exclusively by
printers.

Bronzes — Are pulverized gold, brass, copper
and aluminum. Can be dyed with aniline colors
such as violet, green, etc.

Bone Black — Made by charring bones which are
then finely ground. Semi-transparent.



Burnt Sienna — Raw sienna when burnt yields
a brownish orange, quite transparent.

having bright yellow cup-shaped flowers.

10



### ORIGIN AND DEFINITION OF COLORS.

Bistre Brown— Obtained from soot of wood
fires. A deep citron brown.

Cerulean Blue— A compound of oxides of tin
and cobalt. Opaque, azure blue.

Claret — A red wine color.



Carmine — A very deep toned crimson red, of
the lake family.



Cobalt— A mineral of grayish color, and a metal
obtained from it, which in the state of oxide yields
a permanent blue pigment.

When cobalt blue is unobtainable substitute
ultramarine blue.



Cobalt Blue— A deep, rich, transparent blue of
violet hue. Is often substituted for ultramarine.

Cobalt Green— Semi-transparent bluish green.
This color and cobalt blue are of French origin,
and the process of manufacture is practically the

eamo



same.



Cadmium — A metal related to zinc; produces a
bright semi-transparent yellow or orange hue.

Chrome Yellows — Made by precipitation of po-
tassium bichromate, with lead acetate, varying in
shade from pale yellow to deep orange. They
are opaque, and of good covering strength.

Chinese White — A semi-transparent white of
zinc oxides, equally as white as flake white.

Chrome — (Chromium). A metal which produces
many colors and semi-colors. Chrome green now
takes the place of the dangerous arsenical green
pigment that was formerly used in printers* ink,
enamel and wall paper.

11



### ORIGIN AND DEFINITION OP COLORS.

Chrome Greens — Are a mixture of chrome yel-
low with blue.



Carbon Black — Soot formed with natural gas
and forced through finely woven silk. One thou-
sand cubic feet of gas being required to obtain
one pound of black. Opaque.

Crimson Lake — Transparent red, similar to
carmine, but less scarlet.



Cremnitz White Lead — An opaque white. Made
permanent by coating with varnish.



Coal Tar Dyes — Are derived from coal tar by
distillation and other chemical processes,



### COCHINEAL

Much credit is due the cochineal as most all of
our brightest reds can be attributed to them.

Scarlet and crimson furnish the base for car-
mine and lake. It requires seventy thousand dried
bodies of this small insect to equal one pound of
color.

The task of gathering cochineal is a tedious one.
They are gathered by gently brushing them into
cloth sacks with brushes made of fur just before
egg laying time, as only the bodies of the female
can be used. At this period they are scarlet, the
brightest of all reds. Later they assume a deeper
cast called crimson,



Dye is a colored substance which can be made
soluble in either water or oil.



Dragon's Blood — A resinous substance from the
East Indies. A dull semi-transparent red.



Emerald — A stone or gem of bright green.

marine, discovered by French chemists early in
the nineteenth century. It is more transparent
than the original, and an excellent imitation.



Gypsum — A mineral found in a compact state
and crystallized state, as alabaster, or in the form
of soft, chalky stone which by heat becomes the
fcie white powder known as plaster of paris.



Geranium Lake — A bright transparent red of
bluish hue, also of yellowish hue. Should not be
.nixed with earth pigments such as raw sienna,
ochers, umbers, etc. Geranium lake if a coal tar
product is more permanent than if obtained from
other sources.



Gamboge — A gum resin from trees, native of
Ceylon. Is a bright transparent yellow of little
depth.



Gallstone — Rich deep toned fugitive yellow
from the gall bladder of oxen. Yellow carmine
can be substituted.

Ivory Black — A rich transparent black, from
charred ivory.



Indigo Blue — Deep blue from the leaves of the
Indigofera plant of India.



Intense Blue — Purified Indigo blue.



Indian Yellow — Deposit obtained from the urine
of the camel. A beautiful yellow.

13



### ORIGIN AND DEFINITION OF COLORS.

Indian Red — An earth pigment of Bengal
Ranges in color from a light, bright red to a
dark red of purplish hue; nearly opaque; mixes
well with all other colors except indigo. When
genuine Indian red and indigo come into contact
with one another, they soon assume a faded shade
resembling rust.

Indian red substitute may be mixed with in-
digo substitute in safety; tints made are more
permanent than obtained from the originals.

Lake Colors— The term "lake" as applied to
color pigments, has reference to the method of
manufacture. The pigment is produced by the
saturation of a base with a dye in it, which is
then ground in varnish.

Avoid mixing lake colors with raw earthen
pigments if permanency is desired.

Lamp Black — Is made by burning creosote or
tar oil. Opaque.



Lacquer— A varnish which has the appearance
of enamel.



Maroon — A brownish crimson or claret color.

Mauve— A brilliant red violet, of the lake
group. Also of a bluish violet hue. The most
fugitive of all colors.

Marigold — Several composite plants bearing
golden-yellow flowers.

roots, a climbing perennial.



14



### ORIGIN AND DEFINITION OF COLORS.

Mastic — Resin from a tree of southern Europe,
yielding a varnish.

Mummy Yellow — The ancients obtained a dark
yellow pigment by grinding mummified human
bodies.



Naples Yellow — A pale semi-opaque, straw col-
ored yellow.



The greenish hue of Prussian blue may be neu-
tralized with a touch of crimson lake.



New Blue — Pale ultramarine.



Prussian Blue — Of German origin. A deep
blue, possessing a greenish undertone. A trans-
parent and good covering pigment.

Pure Scarlet — An iodide of mercury. More
brilliant than vermilion and opaque.

en flesh-colored flowers.



Permalba White — A fine opaque white for
artists, etc. Contains neither lead or zinc. Can
safely be mixed with ultramarine and all other
pigments. A product of an Amercan manufac-
turer.



Red Lead — Used on iron prevents rust. Is an
inexpensive product of lead, largely used as barn
paint. Possesses good covering qualities.

Rose Madder or Madder Lake — A beautiful
transparent rose color of a clove or flesh pink
hue. Alizarin, a coal tar product, now affords a
better substitute than the original pigment ob-
tained from the madder plant.

15



### ORIGIN AND DEFINITION OF COLORS.

Raw Sienna — An ocherous transparent earth
pigment of orange-yellow, from Toscany.

Saffron — A bulbous plant, the stigmas of which
are used as a coloring. Yields an orange red ex-
tract.

Some blacks are precipitated oxide of iron and
aniline black made from coal tar dye with the
addition of blue to offset the natural grayish

cast.



Spruce — A name given to several species of
pine trees. Shades vary, but the general hue is
between a light yellowish brown and yellowish

color in the raw state ; burnt umber has a reddish
hue and oftimes called turkey umber.



16



### ORIGIN AND DEFINITION OF COLORS.

Ultramarine Blue — A rare and durable sky blue
obtained from the mineral lapis-lazuli, a stone
found in Asia, The tedious mechanical process of
extracting the color, makes it the most costly of
all pigments.



Ultramarine Ash — Bluish gray of azure hue,
residue of ultra-marine.



Venetian Red — A semi-transparent bright red
with little orange.



Vine Blue — Is made from charred vine twigs.
Is imitated with acetylene gas.

HINTS FOR PAINTERS AND DECORATORS

A house painted white not only looks cool, but is
cool, as white reflects the sun's rays. The effect
at night is reversed.



The amount of trimming color necessary is
usually about one-fifth of that required for the
entire surface.



Do not paint damp or unseasoned, sappy or
pitchy wood.

Do not paint or paper walls having a northern
exposure with cold color such as blue, gray or
white. Use warm tones like rose, tan, etc. And
in like manner better results are obtained by
using the cold shades or colors in rooms with a
southern exposure.

COVERING CAPACITY OF VARNISH

One gallon of varnish will cover approximately
300 square feet, two coats when properly
flowed on.

Varnish is transparent and therefore cannot
hide any defects in a surface. If the surface is
badly marred, use graining materials. Or cover
up the old surface with a suitable paint or
enamel.



NEW WOOD.— Before varnishing new open
grained wood such as oak, ash and mahogany, it
is necessary to fill the pores with a good filler.
Some prefer it in paste form. This is not abso*
lutely necessary for close-grained woods such as
maple, pine and birch.

Paint for general purpose is composed of lead,
zinc, linseed oil and turpentine dryer, which are
the best known ingredients, excepting such colors
that cannot be made from lead and zinc.

Lead, when used alone does not make as ser-
viceable a paint as lead and zinc ground together

47

in pure linseed oil and colors. Zinc is recog
nized as an indespensable ingredient in paint.
Lead, while quite necessary, is likely to change
when used alone by that is meant, it discolors
easily, and when exposed to the air chalks off and
leaves the wood exposed.

Zinc, which is a more durable metal, retains
its whiteness also gives to colors and permits
incorporating the largest possible quantity of
linseeed oil, thus giving life and durability to
the paint. A mixture of both lead and zinc, is,
therefore, necessary to obtain best results to re-
sist light, heat and cold.

NEW WORK

To secure best results, new work should have
three coats, that is two besides the priming coat.

Do not prime or apply paint to a new building
until plastering is thoroughly dried out.

ADULTERATING COLORS
m Do not imagine that the durability of paint is
increased by the use of whiting, clay, silica and
other cheap materials. They only make bulk and
trouble.



AGGRAGATED FORM OF CHECKING
Avoid "alligatoring," which is a form of check-
ing and frequently caused by applying finished
coats over priming or second coats before drying.

SEEDY, SPECKY, SANDY VARNISH
You may find varnish to be full of small grains.
This may be due to chill in transit or in storage,
or a decided difference in temperature between
the varnish and the work. Allow the varnish to
reach the temperature of the work before apply-
ing. The same appearance may be caused by
what painters term a "lousy" brush. USE ONLY
AN ABSOLUTELY CLEAN BRUSH.

PAINT FOR STIPPLING

For rough stipple, mix your paint from equal
parts of white lead in oil, zinc white in oil and
dry plaster of paris (the latter of the finest
grade). Thin down with raw linseed oil and tur-
pentine in equal parts, adding two teaspoonfuls
of pale japan to each pint of liquid. Make the
paint just stout enough to apply with a wall
brush and put it on in that consistency. When
the surface has been so coated, and before the
paint begins to set, use a good size stippler, and
see that you do the vork uniformly and evenly.
You can color the white to any desired tint with
finely powdered dry color or you may use color
ground in oil, but if much of the latter is re-
quired, use one-third raw oil and two-thirds tur-
pentine for thinning. When solid color is de-
sired for wall stippling, use colors ground in oil
and the finest bolted whiting, dry to make stout
paste. Mix in this paste with one part oil and
three parts turpentine and add one part japan.
When the paint is applied in stout consistency, it
may be stippled or combed and very pretty effects
are obtained. Before applying the stipple to un-
painted walls, two coats of pure lead in oil should
be given.



GOOD BRUSHES GET GOOD RESULTS

Keep brushes out of water. When paint and
varnish brushes are not in use, they should be
suspended in raw linseed oil away from the bot-
tom of the container by at least two inches and
at least an inch above the bottom ferrule or
strap. Water is not a paint solvent. When
brushes are suspended in linseed oil, the oil will
dissolve the pigment which, being heavier, will
sink to the bottom of the container, in this way
cleaning the brush.

Quantity Needed.

To ascertain the number of gallons of paint
required for a building: — add the width of front
and rear with the length of both sides, and mul-
tiply by the height. A gallon of paint, proper-
ly brushed out, will cover 350 square feet, two
coats. Do not flow the paint on, but thoroughly
brush it on.

By dividing the total feet of surface by 350,
you will obtain the number of gallons necessary
to paint the house, two coats. The above esti-
mate, owing to the fact that surfaces vary in
their natures, is based on a surface of good con-
dition to receive the paint.

TO REMOVE RUST STAINS FROM
CONCRETE OR STUCCO

Rust stains can be removed from concrete or
stucco work by scrubbing the spots with a solu-
tion of 1 part muriatic acid and 5 parts water.
When using this, the hands should be well pro-
tected from the acid as it is very strong, and
will cause severe burns. After scrubbing the
concrete, the acid must be well rinsed off with
clean water.

ALUMINUM PAINT MAKES RADIATORS
LESS EFFICIENT

The aluminum or bronze paint generally ap-
plied to radiators greatly reduces their effective-
ness and makes it necessary to have a larger
surface for the same heating effect, according to
experiments performed by Dr. W. W. Coblentz,
of the Bureau of Standards. Dr, Coblentz finds
that the heat radiated from an aluminum painted
radiator surface is less than a third of that emit-
ted by a radiator of the same size painted with a
non-matellic paint, enameled, or simply allowed
to rust.

On the other hand, he finds that aluminum
paint is a very effective means of reducing the
amount of heat transmitted through a thin ma-
terial. Applied to the under side of a tent or
awning, it reduces by three-fourths the amount of
heat from the sun which gets through the cloth,
while if used on the cover of an automobile or
ice wagon it cuts in half the heat let through and
makes the temperature inside the vehicle more
nearly that found in natural shade, thereby mak-
ing it much more comfortable.



PAINT AND VARNISH REMOVER

Benzol and denatured alcohol, equal parts ap-
plied to a painted or varnished surface, will eat
through to the bare wood in less than ten min-
utes' time.



HOW ENAMEL IS APPLIED TO METAL
The basis of all enamels is an easily fusible,
colorless glass, to which the desired color and
opacity are imparted by mixtures of metallic ox-
ides. The mass, after being fused together and
cooled, is reduced to a fine powder, washed and
applied to the surfaces to be covered. The whole
is then exposed in a furnace till the enamel is
melted when it adheres firmly to the metal.

placed in a pail, the water added, and the bucket
covered with a piece of old carpet, or an old bag,
and allowed to stand for about an hour; the
whitewash is then ready for application.

WEATHERPROOF WHITEWASH
For exterior use, a weatherproof limewash is
made by slaking 1 bu. (62 lbs.) of quicklime in
15 gal. of water. A solution consisting of 2 lbs.
of ordinary salt and 1 lb. of zinc sulphate, dis-
solved in 2 gals, of boiling water, is prepared,

PROCESS COLOR PRINTING
For the very best results in this fascinating
art, print the lighter colors first, as follows: Yel-
low, red, blue and black unless otherwise instruct-
ed by the engraver.

When dark colors are run first contrary to pro-
gressive proof, the full richness and detail are
lost and hues altered. Light colors printed over
the dark detail, modify and subdue the sharpness
which is not always desirable.

Use opaque yellow for the first color when
printing on tinted stock; follow with transparent
colors.



GOLD SIZE FOR BRONZE POWDER
All pigment that enters into the manufacture
of gold size must be earthen. Yellow ocher is
admirably adapted for this purpose, as in hue it
ranges from a pale yellow to light brown. It is
insoluble in oil and will not dull the luster of
bronze powder or bleed through.

Gold size for pale gold bronze should be pale
yellow; for deep rich gold bronze use medium
light orange brown size.

Deep rich gold when applied over pale yellow
size produces a medium gold cast.

STREAKING AND SHADOWS
Streaking or shadows which occur when run-
ning heavy solids, can of times be overcome on
three roller platen presses by using a steel vi-
brator, also expansion trucks which trip third
roller. If expansion trucks are not available use
vibrator and remove third roller, as in most cases
this roller is causing the trouble.

BLACK AND WHITE AS COLORS

Figuratively speaking black and white are
colors but technically they are not. Pigments
that are jet black and pure white either vege-
table or mineral are unknown. It takes the ad-
dition of blue to alter the yellowish cast of
white, and blue to deepen the brownish cast of
any so called black pigment.

White being a neutral color, will harmonize
with most any color combination.

NEUTRAL HUES AND TINTS
Neutral hues are made by a 50-50 mixture of
warm and cold colors. White added to neutral
hues produce neutral tints.

Whiting— Chalk pulverized and freed from im-
purities.

silvered surface and move the plate back and
forth until it is distributed evenly over the sur-
face.



Soft toned (flat finish) colors and tints are very
desirable in the modern home. The flat or dull
finish prevents the reflection of light, and makes
a desirable back ground for pictures and

SPATTER

method is to spatter through a sieve, with a
round medium stiff brush as shown in the accom-
panying illustration.

With point of knife cut out letters which are
traced from painted show card and paste with
rubber cement, or weight with small objects to
prevent color from running under the edges,
directly on the face of each corresponding letter
and apply spatter. Remove these masks when
the work has dried.

High lights may be added to spatter drawings
with touches of Chinese or show card writers
white with a pencil brush.

Gold ink spatter shows well on dark materials;
white is effective on black material. Pleasing
backgrounds are produced by thinly covering
material with rice, flax seed, leaves, sawdust, etc.
Apply spatter and let thoroughly dry before dis-
turbing to prevent smearing.

PRACTICAL COLOR
SIMPLIFIED

By WILLIAM J. MISKELLA, M.E.




This book answers many vexing questions that
come up unexpectedly every day — the little technical
puzzlers that harass and hinder you most. It con-
tains a wealth of information written in understand-
able form for the novice as well as the experienced
user of colors.

The Color Chart alone is well worth the price of
this entire book. It consists of three sections which
tell how to select warm and cool colors, mix colors
to get any tint or shade, harmonize colors and avoid
color discord. Twenty-five individual colors appear
in the chart, all applied by hand with lacquer to a
cloth backed sheet that cannot be easily damaged.
Mounted on it are the pivoted triangle and the arrow,
both white celluloid, by the use of which color mixing,
matching and harmonizing are simplified.

This book contains 113 pages, illustrated in colors,
bound in cloth, and will be sent postpaid upon re-
ceipt of Price, $3.75.
