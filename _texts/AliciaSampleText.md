PBEFACE

rpHESE pages have to be written many years after the
Kashmiri texts here presented were collected, and amidst
urgent tasks concerning the results gathered in a wholly different
field of work, that of my Central- Asian explorations. These
conditions make me feel particularly grateful for the fact that
Sir George Grierson in his Introduction has dealt so exhaustively
with the manner in which those texts were originally recorded,
and with all aspects of the linguistic interest which may be
claimed for them. It has thus become possible for me to confine
the preface he has asked for to a brief account of the circumstances
which enabled me to gather these materials, and to some personal
notes concerning that cherished Indian scholar friend, the late
Pandit Govind Kaul, whose devoted assistance was largely
instrumental in rendering them of value for linguistic research,
and whose memory this volume is intended to honour.

My interest in the language and folklore of Kashmir directly
arose from the labours which, during the years 1888-98, I devoted,
mainly in the country itself, to the preparation of my critical
edition of Kalhana's Chronicle of the Kings of Kashmir and of my
commentated translation of it. 1 The elucidation of the manifold
antiquarian questions which these tasks implied, and which in
various ways constituted their chief attraction for me, was
possible only in close touch with Kashmir scholars, and needed
constant reference to the traditional lore of their alpine land.
In addition it was necessary for me to effect extensive archaeo-
logical researches on the spot. What leisure I could spare from
onerous and exacting official duties at Lahore for the purely
philological portion of those tasks was far too scanty to permit

of any serious study of Kashmiri. But during the eight summer
vacations which I was privileged to devote in Kashmir to my
>hed labours, and particularly during those between 1891 and
1894, which I spent mostly on archaeological tours elucidating the
historical topography of the country and tracing its ancient
remains, I had opportunities for acquiring some colloquial
familiarity with the language. I should probably have been
able to make more systematic use of these opportunities had not
convenience and conservative attachment to the classical medium
of Kashmir scholarship made me prefer the use of Sanskrit
conversation with my Pandit friends and assistants at Srlnagar
and wherever they shared my tours and campings.

Meanwhile, Sir George Grierson had commenced his expert
linguistic researches concerning Kashmiri. They were, for the
first time, to demonstrate the full interest of the tongue and the
true character of its relationship on the one hand to the Indo-
Aryan vernaculars and on the other to the language group,
called by him " Dardic " or " Pisaca ", the separate existence of
which, within the Aryan branch, he has the merit of having
clearly established. His Kashmiri studies were at the start
directed mainly towards the publication of the remarkable works
by which the late Pandit Isvara Kaul had endeavoured to fix
the phonetic, grammatical, and lexicographical standards for
what he conceived to be the literary form of Kashmiri. There
was every prospect that these standards, through the exhaustive
labours bestowed by Sir George Grierson upon their record and
interpretation, would establish themselves for a language which
so far I. a 1 remained free from the systematizing influence of
Pandit grammarians. Pandit Govind Kaul, though a close
personal friend of Pandit Isvara Kaul, and fully appreciative of
his scholarly zeal and ingenuity, was inclined to doubt at times
the thoroughgoing regularity in the application of all the
â€¢tic distinctions, inflectional rules, etc., laid down by this
Kashrairian epiphany of Panini,



PREFACE xi

I should in no way have felt qualified to decide between the
conflicting authorities, even if I could have spared time for the
close investigation of the differences of detail concerned. But
I realized the value which might attach to an unbiassed phonetic
record of specimens of the language taken down at this stage
from the mouth of speakers wholly unaffected by quasi -literary
influences and grammatical theories. In the course of my
Kashmir tours I had been more than once impressed by the
clearness of utterance to be met with in the speech of intelligent
villagers, very different from the Protean inconstancy which
certain phonetic features of Kashmiri seemed to present in the
mouth of the townsfolk of Srlnagar, whether Brahmans or
Muhammadans. In addition, my interest had been aroused
from the first by the rich store of popular lore which Kashmiri
presents in its folk tales, songs, proverbs, and the like.

So in the course of the second summer season, that of 1896,
which I was enabled through a kind dispensation to devote to
my Rdjatarangini labours in the alpine seclusion of my cherished
mountain camp, Mohand Marg, high up on a spur of the great
Haramukh peaks, I endeavoured to use the chance which had
opportunely offered itself for securing specimens both of the
language spoken in the Sind Valley below me (the important
Laliara tract of old Kashmir) and of folklore texts. Ilatim
Til a won u had been mentioned to me as a professional story-teller
in particular esteem throughout that fertile tract. He was
a cultivator settled in the little hamlet of Panzil, at the con-
fluence of the Sind River and the stream draining the eastern
Haramukh glaciers, and owed his surname to the possession of
an oil press. When he had been induced to climb up to my
mountain height and had favoured Pandit Govind Kaul and
myself with his first recitation, we were both much struck by his
intelligence, remarkable memory, and clear enunciation. His
repertoire of stories and songs was a large one. Though wholly
illiterate, he was able to recite them all at any desired rate of



XII



KASHMIRI STORIES AND SONGS



speed which might suit our ears or pens; to articulate each
word separate from the context, and to repeat it, if necessary,
without any change in pronunciation. Nor did the order of his
words or phrases ever vary after however long an interval he
might he called upon to recite a certain passage again. The
indication of two or three initial words repeated from my written
record would he quite sufficient to set the disk moving in this
living phonographic machine.

It did not take me long to appreciate fully Hatim's value for
the purpose I had in view. He did not at first take kindly to
the cold of our airy camping-place nor to its loneliness, heing
himself of a very sociable disposition, such as befitted his pro-
fessional calling exercised mostly at weddings and other festive
village gatherings. But it was the cultivators' busy season in
the rice fields, some 5,000 feet below us, and his ministrations
were not needed by them for the time being. So I managed, with
appropriate treatment and adequate douceurs, to retain him for
over six weeks. Owing to the.pressure of my work on Kalhana's
Chronicle it was impossible to spare for Hatim more than an hour
in the evening, after a climb, usually in his company, had
refreshed me from the strain of labours which had begun by
daybreak.

Progress was necessarily made slow by the care which
I endeavoured to bestow upon the exact phonetic record of
irntim's recitation and the consequent need of having each word
where I did not feel sure of it, repeated, eventually several
times. Whenever a story was completed I used to read it out
to Hatim, who never failed to notice and correct whatever
deviation from his text might have crept in through inadvertence
Ql defective hearing. Though able to follow the context in
general, I purposely avoided troubling Hatim with queries about
particular words or sentences which I could not readily under-
stand. I felt that the object in view would be best served by
concentrating my attention upon the functions of a phonographic

recorder and discharging them as accurately as the limitations
of my ear and phonetic training would permit.

I could not have adopted this safe restriction of my own task,
and might well have hesitated about attempting the record of
these materials at all, if I had not been assured from the start
of Pandit Govind Kaul's most competent and painstaking
collaboration. The intimate knowledge which long years of
scholarly work carried on in constant close contact had given me
of his methods and standards, enabled me to leave certain
essential portions of the work entirely to his share and with
fullest confidence in the result. I could feel completely
assured that with that rare thoroughness and conscientious
precision which distinguished all his work on the lines of the
traditional Sanskrit scholar, his record of Hatim's text written
down in Devanagarl characters simultaneously with my own
would be as exact as the system, or want of system, of Kashmiri
spelling current among Srlnagar Pandits would permit. I was
equally certain that he would spare no trouble to make his
interpretation of it, both in the form of an interlinear word-for-
word version and of an idiomatic Sanskrit translation, as accurate
as possible.

Sir George Grierson's remarks upon the advantages which he
derived from Pandit Govind KauFs labours make it unnecessary
for me to explain here the special value attaching to them.
It will suffice to state that Pandit Govind Kaul's text as written
down at the time of dictation was always revised simultaneously
with my own. The interlinear translation was then added in
the course of the following day, after reference to Hatim
wherever doubts arose about the meaning of particular words or
phrases. The preparation of the fair copy of both, with the
idiomatic Sanskrit rendering added, was a task which helped to
keep Pandit Govind Kaul occupied during my absence in Europe
for part of 1897. During the summer of the next year I enjoyed
once more the benefit of his devoted assistance in labours dear to

us



both, and in the peaceful seclusion of my alpine camp. But
my big Rdjatarangini task, then nearing completion, claimed all
my energy and time. Thus the lacuna left in Pandit Govind
Kaul's record of Hatim's last tale, due to the accidental loss of
the concluding few pages of his original manuscript, escaped
attention at the time.

When it was brought to my notice by Sir George Grierson
fully fourteen years later, I was encamped once more at the very
spot where we had recorded those stories. But, alas, Pandit
Govind Kaul was no longer among the living to give aid ; and,
what with years of Central- Asian exploration and long labours
on their results intervening, those records seemed to me as if
gathered in a former birth. Fortunately, Hatim was still alive
and quite equal to the stiff climb which his renewed visit
demanded â€” the photograph reproduced here shows him as he
looked then. His recollection of the story was as fresh as ever,
though increasing years and prosperity had made him give up
his peregrinations as a public story-teller. So it was easy for
another old retainer, Pandit KasI Earn, to take down from
Hatim's dictation the missing end of the story ; it ran exactly
as my own record showed it.

During the years which followed the completion of my main
Kashmir labours the efforts needed to carry out successive
Central-Asian expeditions and to assure the elaboration of their
abundant results, kept me from making definite arrangements
for the publication of those linguistic materials. They had
meanwhile, together with my collection of Sanskrit manuscripts
ironi Kashmir, found a safe place of deposit in the Indian
Institute's Library at Oxford. But it filled me with grateful
relief when my old friend Sir George Grierson, after a pre-
liminary examination, kindly agreed in the autumn of 1910 to
publish these texts, and thus enabled me , to leave them in the
hands most competent for the task.

It was the solution I had hoped for all along, and realizing



PREFACE xv

how much more difficult this task was than the original collection
of the materials, I feel deep gratification at the fact that a
kindly Fate has allowed him to complete it amidst all his great
labours. In view of all the progress which Indian linguistic
research for more than a generation past owes to Sir George
Grierson's exceptional qualifications and powers of critical work,
it would be presumption on my part to appraise how much of
the value which may be claimed for this publication is derived
solely from the wide range and precision of the scholarly
knowledge he has brought to bear upon it.

It is the greatness of his own share in the work which makes
me feel particularly grateful to Sir George Grierson for his ready
consent to its dedication to the memory of Pandit Govind Kaul.
It affords me an appropriate opportunity for recording some
data about the life of a cherished friend and helpmate whose
memory deserves to be honoured for the nobility of his character
quite as much as for his scholarly gifts and labours. The
association of Pandit Govind Kaul during close on ten years with
my own efforts bearing on the history and antiquities of Kashmir
has always been appreciated by me as a special favour of Fortune,
or â€” to name the goddess under her own Kashmirian form â€” of
Silrada, who is the protectress of learning as well as of the alpine
land which claims to be her home ; for he seemed to embody in
his person all the best characteristics of that small but important
class among the Brahmans of Kashmir to which the far-off and
secluded mountain territory owes its pre-eminent position in the
history of Indian learning and literature.

I cannot attempt to indicate here the evidence to be gathered
both from the Sanskrit literary products of Kashmir and from
surviving local tradition, which makes me believe that high
scholarly attainments and a special facility of elegant rhetorical
or poetic expression were to be found among the truly learned
in Kashmir more frequently combined than elsewhere in India
with a keen eye for the realities of life, power of humorous

observation, and distinct interest in the practical affairs
of the country. Kalhana himself, the author of the Rdja-
farahf/im, with whose personality, I felt, I was becoming so
familiar across the gap of long centuries, seemed aptly to
illustrate this typical combination of features. 1 In Pandit
Govind Kaul I found them all again and united with a high
sense of honour, a bearing of true innate nobility, and a capacity
for faithful attachment which from the first made me cherish
him greatly as a friend, not merely as an accomplished mentor
in most things appertaining to Kashmir and its traditional past.
A brief account of his descent and early associations will best
explain the growth of these strongly-marked characteristics. 2

Pandit Govind Kaul was born in 1846 as the eldest son
of Pandit Balabhadra Kaul (1819-96), who, by reason of his
personal qualities, great scholarly attainments, and social position,
was universally respected among the Brahman community of
Srlnagar. Pandit Balabhadra's own father, Pandit Taba Haul,
had been a Sanskrit scholar of great reputation in the closing
period of Afghan rule in Kashmir. Being connected as
hereditary ' Guru ' with the important Brahman family of the
Dars he had enjoyed a substantial Jaglr, and this was allowed
to continue when Maharaja Eanjit Singh's conquest in 1819
established Sikh dominion over Kashmir. Pandit Blrbal Dar y
his patron, had held an influential administrative position
already under the Afghan regime. But he incurred tlje
suspicion of 'Azlm Khan, the last governor from Kabul, and
persecuted by him, he was obliged to flee from Kashmir to
the Pan jab. Of the adventurous escape which he made with

* For the account here presented I have been able to utilize a series of notes
which Pandit Govind Kaul's son, Pandit Nilakanth, collected at my request
among the elder members of his family and also among the surviving repre-
sentatives of the Dar family, their hereditary patrons. In addition my
recollection of data verbally communicated to me by Pandit Govind Kaul has
proved useful.



PEE FACE xvii

his young son Pandit Raj akak, in mid-winter 1818-19, across the
snow -covered mountains, and of the cruel treatment endured
by those of his family he was obliged to leave behind,
Pandit Govind Kaul told me interesting traditions. The
experienced advice which Pandit Blrbal supplied to Maharaja
Ran jit Singh is believed to have contributed greatly to the
success of the campaign, which, in the following summer, placed
Kashmir in the power of the great Sikh ruler. 1

The high administrative posts which Pandit Blrbal, and after
his death his equally capable son Pandit Raj akak, held during
the period of Sikh rule in Kashmir (1819-46), necessarily
assured a prominent social position and relative affluence also
for Pandit Taba Kaul and his son Pandit Balabhadra Kaul.
The latter was thus enabled to devote himself during his
youth solety to Sanskrit studies, and to lay the foundations
of a scholarly renown which made him, from an early date,
a prominent figure among the Pandits of Kashmir. But the
far-reaching political changes which followed the accession of
Maharaja Gulab Singh of Jammu to the rule of Kashmir at
the close of the First Sikh War, in 1846, led to the loss of
the family's Jaglr and threw a heavy strain upon Pandit
Balabhadra's resources. Though restricted to what income his
functions as hereditary Guru and as a teacher of Sastras could
secure, and maintaining throughout his long life a dignified
retirement, 2 Pandit Balabhadra succeeded not only in giving his

1 Pandit Blrbal is said to have been personally present at the fight on the
Div a sar Karewa in which the Afghans were finally defeated by Diwan Chand
Misar and Sardar Hari Singh, Ranjit Singh's generals, and to have decided
the issue by pointing out Jabar Khan, 'Azim Khan's brother and ablest
commander, as the chief objective for the attack. I may mention as an
interesting relic connected with this event that in the palace-like mansion of
the Dar family, a monument of departed glory, I found a number of fine
Persian carpets and elaborate felt rugs which according to family tradition
Pandit Blrbal had been allowed to appropriate from the defeated Afghan
governor's camp in recognition of the help he had rendered towards the Sikh
success on that field of battle.

the precincts of the Dar family mansion, though receiving frequent visitors
from among those whom office or intellectual attainments placed high in the
social world of Srinagar.

three sons an excellent education, but in accumulating also an
important collection of Sanskrit manuscripts.

His tasks were, no doubt, facilitated by the support he derived
from his close connexion with the remarkably able men who
succeeded Pandit Blrbal as heads of the Dar family. Pandit
Rajakiik, the latter's son (1805-66), had distinguished himself
as an administrator already during the troubled times of the
closing Sikh regime, and quelled a rebellion in the hill tract
of Drava. When conditions had become more settled under
the Dogra rule he rose high in Maharaja Ghilab Singh's favour
by greatly developing the shawl industry of Kashmir, then
a monopoly and financial mainstay of the State. Endowed
with a genuine love of knowledge and with that intellectual
adaptability which has distinguished the best brains of Kashmir
through successive historical periods, he had taken care to secure
for his son, Pandit Ramjlv Dar (circ. 1850-83), not only a
sound training in Persian and Sanskrit, but also some familiarity
with English and with Western ways. It was no easy departure
in days when close relations with Europeans were apt to be looked
at askance as infringing upon the traditional policy of seclusion
and the security it was meant to assure.

It was in intimate association with Pandit Ramjlv Dar that
Pandit Govind Kaul spent most of his early manhood. The
experience he thus gained of the world of affairs, of rulers and
ruled alike, did much to widen the horizon of his thoughts
and interests beyond that of the traditional student of Siistras.
Pandit Ramjlv seems to have been a man of an unusually active
mind and of considerable practical energy. During his short
but fruitful life he had the good fortune to serve a ruler so
well qualified as the late Maharaja Ranblr Singh to appreciate
his varied mental gifts and activities. It was the cherished aim
of the late Maharaja to combine the preservation of inherited
systems of Indian thought and knowledge with the development
of his country's economic resources along the lines of modern

Western progress. Having proved his ability as an administrator
of Kashmir districts, Pandit Eamjlv gradually became the
Maharaja's trusted adviser in a variety of departments which
were created to further that policy, including those of education,
agriculture, sericulture, etc. The manifold administrative duties
entrusted to Pandit Eamjlv did not divert his attention from
scholarly interests, and consequently he kept Pandit Govind
Kaul as much as possible by his side wherever his tours of
inspection, etc., took him. Thus, Pandit Govind Kaul was able
to acquire a great deal of first-hand knowledge of Kashmir and
the neighbouring territories in all their varied aspects.

Pandit Govind Kaul had, from his earliest youth, received
a very thorough literary training in Sanskrit under his father's
direct guidance. In accordance with the traditions of Kashmir
learning he had devoted particular efforts to the study of the
Alamkara-sastra and the poetic literature which is bound up
with it. His stock of quotations from the latter seemed in-
exhaustible. He was thoroughly at home also in Yyakarana,
Nyaya and the Saiva-sastra, and he read widely in the Epics
and Purilnas. As far as Sanskrit literary qualifications were
concerned, he was well equipped for the charge of the "Translation
Department ", to which he was appointed in 1874. By creating
it together with a State Press it was the Maharaja's intention to
diffuse a knowledge of Sanskrit works on law, philosophy, etc.,
among wider classes of his subjects through the medium of
Hindi. Other branches of the same department were intended
to secure the same object with regard to selected works in
English and Persian. It is needless to discuss here the practical
utility of the scheme or the causes which, owing to the lingering
illness of the Maharaja, hampered its execution during the
closing years of his reign. It is enough to remember that it
provided suitable employments for such highly deserving scholars
as Pandit Govind Kaul and the late Pandit Sahajabhatta, who
was to become another of my Kashmir assistants, and that

among the works undertaken, but never finished, there was also
a Hindi translation of the Sanskrit Chronicles of Kashmir.

In 1883 Pandit Ramjiv Dar was carried off by a premature
death. Soon after, the Translation Department ceased to exist,
together with several other institutions which had owed their
creation to his stimulating influence. The last years preceding
Maharaja Ranbir Singh's death in 1886 and the first of the
reign of his son and successor were for Kashmir a period of
transition. Traditional methods of administration and economic
conditions bequeathed by long centuries of practical seclusion
were giving way without there being the machinery as yet
available to effect needful reforms on the lines developed in
British India. It was in various ways a trying time for all
those representing the intellectual inheritance of the valley, and
after a short spell of work as a teacher in the Sanskrit Pathasala,
maintained by the Darbar at Srlnagar, on scant pay â€” and that
often in arrears â€” Pandit Grovind Kaul found himself without
official employment.

His learning and sound methods of scholarly work had already,
in 1875, attracted the attention of Professor Greorge Biihler,
when that great Indologist had paid his memorable visit to
Kashmir in search of Sanskrit MSS. The very commendatory
mention which Professor Buhler's report made of Pandit Govind
Kaul's attainments and of the help he had rendered, 1 directed
my attention to him from the start. The personal impression
gained within the first few days of my arrival at Srlnagar at
the close of August, 1888, was quite sufficient to convince me
how amply deserved that praise was. I was quick to notice
Pandit Govind Kaul's special interest in antiquarian subjects,
such as made me then already form the plan of a critical edition

1 Cf. Biihler, "Detailed Report of a Tour in search of Sanskrit MSS. made
in KaHinir, Rajputana, and Central India," Extra Number of the Journal
Bombay Branch, R.A.S., 1877, pp. 7, 17, 27. In the last-quoted passage
Professor Buhler mentions Pandit Govind Kaul's shrewd identification of the
old local name of Leh ( Loh in the Rajat. ), and rightly states : "His proceeding
showed that he was possessed of a truly scientific spirit of enquiry."

and commentary of Kalhana's Chronicle of Kashmir. I was
equally impressed by his dignified personality, which combined
the best qualities of the Indian scholar and gentleman. A short
archaeological tour which we made in company to sites round the
Dal Lake helped to draw us together in mutual sympathy and
regard. So it was to me a great source of satisfaction when,
before my departure for the plains, Pandit Govind Kaul, with
his revered father's full approval, accepted my offer of personal
employment and agreed to follow me to Lahore for the cold
weather season.

It was the beginning of a long period of close association
between us in scholarly interests and work. It continued
practically unbroken for nearly eleven years, throughout my
official employment in the Pan jab University at Lahore, and
down to Pandit Govind Kaul's lamented death in June, 1899.
Neither my visits on leave to Europe nor an interval in 1892-3,
when he was tempted to accept employment at the Court of
Jammu on H.H. the Maharaja's private staff, implied any real
interruption. It was, in the first place, my labours concerning
the critical publication and elucidation of Kalhana's Chronicle of
Kashmir, for which Pandit Govind Kaul's multifarious and ever
devoted assistance proved of the greatest value. As to the
character and extent of this help it is unnecessary here to give
details. They have been recorded at length, and with due
expression of my gratitude, both in the Introduction to my text
edition of the Rajatarahginl, published in 1892, and in the
Preface to the commentated translation of it, with which, in
1900, on the eve of departure for my first Central- Asian
expedition, I completed my labours bearing on the early history
and antiquities of Kashmir. 1

Nor need I give here details regarding the large share taken
by Pandit Govind Kaul in another impdrtant if not equally

attractive task. I mean the preparation of a classified catalogue
of the great collection of Sanskrit MSS., over 5,000 in number,
which, through Maharaja Ranblr Singh's enlightened care, had
been formed at the Raghunath Temple Library at Jammu. The
support I received from successive British residents in Kashmir,
including the late Colonels E. Parry Nisbet and N. F. Prideaux,
and from my old friend the late Raja Pandit Suraj Kaul, then
Member of the Kashmir State Council, furnished me with the
means for organizing the labours by which, in the course of
1889-94, this very valuable collection was saved from the risk
of dispersion and rendered accessible to research. They were
effected mainly through Pandit Govind Kaul and our common
friend the late Pandit Sahajabhatta. A full acknowledgment
of their devoted services will be found in the Introduction to
the volume which contains the descriptive catalogue, together
with the plentiful and accurate extracts prepared by them from
previously unknown or otherwise interesting Sanskrit texts. 1

It would have been quite impossible for me, burdened as
I was all through my years at Lahore with heavy and exacting
official duties, to undertake the big tasks referred to, had not
a kindly Fortune provided me in Pandit Govind Kaul with
a coadjutor of exceptional qualities. With a wide range of
thorough traditional knowledge of the Sastras and a keen sense
of literary form he combined a standard of accuracy and a
capacity for taking pains over details which would have done
high credit to any European scholar trained on modern philo-
logical lines. Though he was no longer young when he joined
me, he adapted himself with instinctive comprehension to the
needs of Western critical methods, such as I was bound to apply
to all my tasks. With infinite and never-failing care he would
record and collate the readings of the manuscripts upon which
I depended for the critical constitution of the Rdjatarangini

text, and also those of other Kashmir ian works, almost all
unpublished, reference to which was constantly needed for its
interpretation. Yet I knew that scrupulously careful as he was
about the formal correctness of his Sanskrit writing and speech,
the exact reproduction of all the blunders, etc., to be met in
the work of often ignorant copyists caused him a kind of
physical pain.

It was the same with the labours he had to devote to the
collection and sifting of all the multifarious materials needed
for the elucidation of antiquarian problems. However much
wanting in style and other literary attractions the Kashmirian
texts such as Mahatmyas, later Chronicles, etc., might be which
had to be searched, I could always feel sure that none of their
contents which might be of interest by their bearing on the
realities of ancient Kashmir would be allowed by Pandit Govind
Kaul to escape his Index slips. The value of the help he could
give me in regard to the latter labours was greatly increased by
the familiarity he had gained with most parts of the country
and its varied population during the years spent by the side
of his old patron Pandit Ramjlv Dar. Though for various
practical reasons I had but little occasion to use Pandit Govind
Kaul in that role of travelling camp literatus which made his
worthy Chinese epiphany, excellent Chiang Ssu-yeh, so invaluable
to me during my Central- Asian explorations of 1906-8, he was
yet exceptionally well able to visualize topographical and other
practical facts bearing on archaeological questions.

But, perhaps, the greatest advantage I derived from his long
association with my labours was the chance it gave me to study
in close contact those peculiarities of traditional Indian thought,
belief, and conduct which separate Hindu civilization so deeply
both from the West and the East, and which no amount of
book knowledge could ever fully reveal to a  Mleccha '.
Pandit Govind Kaul's personality seemed to embody in a
particularly clear fashion some of the most characteristic and

puzzling features which constitute the inherited mentality of
India, traceable through all changes of the ages. Attached with
unquestioning faith to the principles and practices of his Brahman
caste, he would make no concessions whatsoever in his own person
to altered conditions of life. Yet he was- ever ready to explain
to me how the slow adaptation in others was reconcilable with
traditional tenets. His meticulous observance of religious rites
shrank from no personal hardship or sacrifice; he would, e.g., keep
the fast days enjoined by the three different systems of worship
traditional in his family, even when the chance of the calendar
would bring them together in most embarrassing succession.
Yet, in the privacy of my study or in the solitude of my
mountain camp he was fully prepared to brush aside in my case
most of the outward restrictions to which the profanum rnlgus
might attach importance.

His strongly conservative notions were the clearest reflex of
those which have governed the administration of Kashmir
throughout its historical past. Their instinctive application by
Pandit Govind Kaul to the modern conditions of his country
helped me greatly in comprehending how limited in reality were
the changes undergone by its social fabric in the course of long
centuries, notwithstanding all foreign conquests from the north
and south. In his unfailing grave politeness and courtly dignity
I could recognize, as it were, the patina which generations of
influential employment and social distinction have deposited on
the best representatives of the true ruling class of Kashmir.
Whenever Pandit Govind Kaul was by my side, whether in the
alpine peace of my beloved Kashmir mountains or in the dusty
toil of our Lahore exile, I always felt in living touch with past
ages full of interest for the historical student of India.

A kindly Fate had allowed me, notwithstanding constant
struggles for leisure, to carry my labours on the oldest historical
records of Kashmir close to their completion by the time when in
the spring of 1899 my appointment to the charge of the Calcutta



PEE FACE xxv

Madrasa and the far more encouraging prospect of freedom for
my first Central-Asian journey necessitated what seemed merely
a temporary change in our personal association. In view of the
new field of work which was soon to call me to the * Sea of
Sand' and its ruins far away in the north, I felt anxious to
assure to Pandit Govind Kaul scholarly employment in his own
home, worthy of his learning and likely to benefit research.
By what appeared at the time a special piece of good fortune,
my friend Sir George Grierson was then anxious to avail
himself of Pandit Govind Kaul's methodical help for completing
and editing Pandit Isvara Haul's great dictionary of Kashmiri.
It was a philological task of considerable importance, and for
more than one reason I rejoiced when, before my departure from
Lahore, this collaboration of the best Kashmirian scholar of his
time with the leading authority in the field of Indian linguistic
research had been satisfactorily arranged for.

But Fate, with that inscrutable irony on which Pandit Govind
Kaul, like another Kalhana, 1 loved to expatiate with appropriate
poetic quotations, had decreed otherwise. The farewell I took
at Lahore from my ever devoted helpmate was destined to be
the last. From a rapid visit to Simla to see Sir George
Grierson he brought back an attack of fever which, after his
return to Kashmir, proved to be of a serious type and ultimately
was recognized as typhoid. For weeks his strong constitution
held out, supported by the loving care of his family and such
proper medical attendance as I endeavoured to assure from afar.
But in the end he succumbed, and separated by thousands of
miles at the time in the strange mountains of Sikkim, I learned
early in June, 1899, the grievous m news that my best Indian
friend had departed beyond all hope of reunion in this janman.

Pandit Govind Kaul left behind a widow, who, after years of
pious devotion to his memory, has since followed him, and
a young son, Pandit Nilakanth Kaul, who, while prevented by

indifferent health in early youth from following a scholar's
career, has grown up worthily to maintain the family's reputation
for high character and unswerving devotion to duty.

The prolonged stays I was subsequently able to make in Kashmir
before and after my successive Central-Asian expeditions had to
be spent on work relating to regions far away, and wholly
different in character, from what I have come to look upon as
my Indian alpine home. But my love for Kashmir has remained
unchanged, and so also my gratitude for the great boon it had
given me in Pandit Govind Kaul's friendship and help. That
I was enabled to prefix a record of his life to this volume and
thus to do something to preserve his memory, is a privilege
I appreciate greatly. I owe it solely to the scholarly zeal of
Sir George Grierson, who has rescued and elaborated the
materials which we had collected, in a previous common birth,
as it were. For the personal service thus rendered the
expression of my warmest thanks is due here in conclusion.

Aurel Stein.

INTRODUCTION

THE stories and songs in the following pages were recited to
Sir Aurel Stein in June and July, 1896, at Mohand Marg,
in Kashmir, by Hatim Tilawoii u , of Panzil, in the Sind Valley,
a cultivator and professional story- teller. They were taken
down at his dictation by Sir Aurel Stein himself, and,
simultaneously, by Pandit Govinda Kaula, and were read again
by Sir Aurel with Hatim in August, 1912. Sir Aurel Stein
wrote the text phonetically in the Roman character, as he
heard it, and Govinda Kaula recorded it in the Nagarl
character, not phonetically, but spelling the words in the
manner customary among Kashmir Pandits of Srlnagar.
While there are necessarily considerable differences in the
representation of Hatim's words, the two texts are in verbatim
agreement. Only in very rare instances are unimportant
words found in one omitted in the other. To the copy made
by him from Hatim's dictation Govinda Kaula added an inter-
linear, word for word, translation into Sanskrit, and, from this,
he subsequently made a fair copy of the greater part of the
text with a translation into idiomatic Sanskrit.

All these materials were handed over to me by Sir Aurel
Stein in November, 1910, and a perusal of them at once showed
their great importance. They were a first-hand record of
a collection of folklore taken straight from the mouth of one
to whom they had been handed down with verbal accuracy
from generation to generation of professional Rawls or reciters,
and, in addition, they formed an invaluable example of a little-
known language recorded in two ways, viz. : (1) as it sounded
to an experienced scholar, and (2) as it was written down in
the literary style of spelling. Moreover, Hatim's language was
not the literary language of Kashmiri Pandits, but was in
a village dialect, and Sir Aurel Stein's phonetic record of the
patois, placed alongside of the standard spelling of Kashmiri
Pandits, gives what is perhaps the only opportunity in existence



XXV111



KASHMIRI STORIES AND SONGS



for comparing the literary form of an Oriental speech with the
actual pronunciation of a fairly educated villager. I, therefore,
gratefully undertook the task of editing these tales with a view
to their publication.

As I progressed, various difficulties asserted themselves, and
Sir Aurel Stein took advantage of a stay in Kashmir in August,
1912, to interview Hatim once more, to read through the text
with him again, and, by inquiry from the fount of inspiration,
to obtain a solution of the puzzles. The result was a remarkable
proof of the accuracy of Hatim's memory. As already intimated,
he belonged to a family of Kawis, and delivered the stories as
he had received them. After sixteen years, the text that he
recited in 1912 was the same as that which had been copied
down in 1896. It even contained one or two words or phrases
of which he did not know the meaning. They were "old
words" no longer in use, but he still recited them as he had
received them from his predecessor.

In the course of my examination of the papers, I found that
Govinda Kaula's transcript was not quite complete. It extended
only to the middle of paragraph 18 of Story xii. In the
interval between 1896 and 1912 had occurred the lamented
death of that excellent scholar, and his help was no longer
available to supply the missing portion. This was, therefore,
written down in August, 1912, from Hatim's dictation, and
supplied with a Hindi translation by Pandit Kail Rama.

The method employed by me in editing the text is as follows :
Sir Aurel Stein's phonetic text is first printed with a free
English translation. This is followed by a careful transliteration
of Govinda Kaula's text, with an interlinear, word for word,
translation into English. As this latter text is based on the
Pandit's system of spelling, every word is spelt the same way
every time that it occurs, and I was able to compile from it
a very full vocabulary, which also served as an Index Verborum.
As Hatim's pronunciation, like the pronunciation of all spoken
words in any language, varied slightly almost every time that
the same word was uttered, Sir Aurel Stein's phonetic transcript
has necessarily no fixed system of spelling any particular word,

each word being recorded as it sounded on the particular
occasion of its being uttered, without reference to its pro-
nunciation on other occasions. 1 Each word, therefore, appears
under varying forms, all of which are, of course, of inestimable
value for the study of the growth of dialect, but which render
the text unsuitable as the basis of a vocabulary. For this
reason, as stated above, my vocabulary is based on Govinda
Kaula's text ; but, to make comparison easy, two further
indexes have been added. The first is an index of all the
words in Sir Aurel's phonetic text, showing in each case the
corresponding word in Govinda Kaula's text. The second
index takes the words in the latter text, but arranges them in
the order of their final letters, it being the letters towards the
end of a word that are most liable to change in the processes
of declension or conjugation. For each word in this text the
corresponding word or words in Sir Aurel's text are also given.

The tales and songs are recorded in the order in which they
were taken down by Sir Aurel Stein. They include six
excellent folk-tales, three songs, and three tales partly in prose
and partly in verse. The folk-tales speak for themselves.
Of the songs, one (No. i) is a poetical account of an adventure
of the famous Sultan Mahmud of Ghaznl with a fisherman ;
another (No. iv) purports to give a resume of the origins of
the Musalman religion ; and the third (No. xi) is an amusing
account of the turmoil created in Kashmir by Sir Douglas
Forsyth's mission to Yarkand in 1873-4. The tales partly in
prose and partly in verse are, first, the well-known story of
Yusuf and Zulaikha, told by Wahab Khar 2 (No. vi). The



1 In regard to this point we may compare Noldeke's words in a review of
Prym & Socin's account of the Dialect of Tur 'Abdln (ZDMG. xxxv, 221):
"Die ungemeine Genauigkeit in der Wiedergabe der Laute zeigt iibrigens
wieder besonders deutlich, wie verschieden oft ein und dasselbe Wort sogar im
selben Zusammenhange, ja im selben Satze gesprochen wird : ein auch durch
sonstige Niederschrift aus dem Volksmunde bestatigtes Resultat, durch
welches allein schon das jetzt so beliebte Dogma von der ' unbedingten
Wirkung der Lautgesetze ' als eine arge UebertreibuUg erwiesen wird. Man
bedenke, dass diese Texte sammtlich aus dem Munde eines einzigen, vollig
illiteraten Mannes aufgezeichnet sind."

2 It is, of course, quite different from the long Kashmiri Yusvf Zulaikha, of
Mahmud Garni, published by K. P. Burkhard in ZDMG. xlix, liii.

second is the lamentation of a reed, torn from its forest, and
tortured by a carpenter till it becomes a flute (No. vii). The
author is one Subhan. The third, which is anonymous, is
a curious conversation between a bee and a farmer's wife
(No. ix), in which the former complains of tyranny done to it
by a bear and by a farmer who robbed it of its honey, while
the latter complains of the tyranny done to her by grasping
revenue officials.

Three notes are appended to this Introduction. For the first
we are indebted to the kindness of Mr. Crooke. In this note
he has placed at the disposal of the readers of the following
pages his great experience in the science of comparative
folklore, and has discussed the relationships of Hatim's tales to
similar stories current in other parts of the world. In the
second note I have dealt with the natures of the two texts and
with the philological lessons that may be drawn from them.
In the third, Sir Aurel Stein discusses the metre of the songs.

I

ON THE FOLKLORE IN THE STORIES

By Mb. W. CROOKE

This collection of folk-tales and ballads from Kashmir presents
many features of interest. In the following notes I have not
attempted to discuss the general question of their value and of
the sources from which they may have been derived. I have
confined myself to collecting a series of parallels to the motifs
and incidents of the stories, largely drawn from oriental sources.
For several of these parallels I am indebted to notes prepared
by Sir G. Grierson, Dr. E. Sidney Hartland, and Canon J. A.
MacCulloch. These have been specially acknowledged.

I. MAHMUD OF GHAZNI AND THE FISHERMAN

In this story the Sultan Mahmud, famous for his series of

raids in Northern India, like the Khallfah Harun-al-Rashid,

is described as wandering through the city in the disguise of

a Faqir in search of information. The tale, in fact, is possibly



INTBODUCTION xxxi

a reminiscence of one of the most interesting stories in " The
Arabian Nights ", " Khalifah, the Fisherman of Baghdad," *
where the Caliph becomes the partner of Khalifah, the fisherman.
In the same collection there is a similar incident in the tale of
'* Nur al-Din 'All and the Damsel Anis al-Jalis ", where the
Caliph becomes partner of Karim, the fisherman. 2

II. THE TALE OF A PARROT
Sir G. Grierson compares with the tale the well-known story
of Vikramaditya in the Pancatantra, of which numerous
variants have been collected by M. E. Cosquin. 3 Dr. E. Sidney
Hartland writes : " In addition to the variants cited by M. E.
Cosquin at the reference given, see The History of the Forty
Vezirs, translated by Mr. E. J. W. Gibb, 4 in which a king learns
a charm from a Darvesh and communicates it to his Wazir,
who practises it upon him at the first opportunity. The king
is forced to enter and re-animate a dead parrot, which persuades
the gardener to sell it to a courtesan. She claims a thousand
sequins as her fee for a visit which she alleges she had paid to
a merchant. She had, however, seen this incident only in
a dream. The parrot judges between the parties, and is then
sold to the king's chief wife. The Wazir, who has meanwhile
succeeded in occupying the vacant body of the king, boasts to
the queen of his knowledge of the charm. She persuades him
to try it. The parrot, who is present, watching his opportunity,
gets possession of his own body and kills the Wazir." The
tale is an illustration of the folk-taleÂ«cycle, " The Separable
Soul." In a tale from the Panjab, while a man was asleep,
his soul went wandering about. By and by the soul felt
thirsty and went into a pitcher of water to get a drink.
While it was inside the pitcher someone put on the lid and
imprisoned the soul. When the soul of the man did not
return he was believed to be dead, and his corpse was

carried out for cremation. By chance someone took the lid
off' the pitcher and released the soul, which at once returned
to its proper owner's body. He revived amidst general
rejoicings. 1 The parrot in the tale under consideration is
what has been called " The Life-Index " of the king. 2

III. THE TALE . OP A MERCHANT
The plot turns on the intrigue of a dissolute woman with
a beggarman. Sir G. Grierson quotes a variant from the
Linguistic Survey of India. 2 In the JoHaha* the Queen
Kinnara falls in love with "a loathsome, misshapen cripple".
The king, when she is detected in this intrigue, orders that
her hand should be chopped off. But his chaplain dissuades
him : " Sire ! be not angry with the queen ; all women are
just the same." In the collection of Somadeva, " The Story
of the Wife of Sasin," the lady, in the absence of her
husband, visits a man whose hands and feet are eaten away
by leprosy ; and in another tale from the same collection,
"The Story of the Wife of King Simhaksa, and the Wives
of his Principal Courtiers," the ladies fall in love with the
hump-backed, the blind, and the lame. 5 The stock example
of this form of tale, the tragedy of which' is admirably
enhanced by the contrast between a beautiful woman and
her loathsome paramour, is the tale from " The Arabian
Nights", "The Tale of the Ensorcelled Prince." 6 Here the
vicious wife visits a hideous negro slave, a person who, in
oriental tales, is often selected as a paramour by dissolute
women. He lives in a hole amidst the rubbish-heaps of
the city. " Uncover this basin," he says in a grumbling
tone, " and thou shalt find at the bottom the boiled bones
of some rats we dined on ; pick at these, and then go to

the slop-pot, where thou shalt find some leavings of beer
which thou mayest drink."

The tale then diverges into the common motif of the
love of a mortal for fairies, who live in a world of their
own to which there is access by a spring, the moral being
that the merchant is no better than his erring wife. In the
story of " The Queen of the Fairies ", the hero in this way
finds Ratnamanjari, daughter of the king of the Vidhya-
dharas, marries her by the Gandharva rite, and loses her in
consequence of the violation of a taboo, a common incident
in this cycle of stories. 1 With this may be compared
Somadeva's stories : " The King who married his dependent
to the Nereid," and " Yasah Ketu, the Vidhyadhaii Wife,
and his Faithful Minister " ; and in " The Arabian Nights ",
" The Second Kalandar's Tale ", and " Julnar the Seaborn
and her Son. King Badr Basim of Persia". 2



V. THE TALE OF THE GOLDSMITH
This is based on a familiar folk-tale incident â€” the
Language of Signs. In the tale of " The Prince and the
Vizier's Son", 3 the princess " pointed to her breast, then to
her head, and, lastly, she laid her hand upon a vessel which
stood beside her ". This is interpreted to mean : When she
put her hand on her forehead she showed that she was
Cashma Rani, or " Eye Queen " ; when she touched her
breast, " my heart shall be thine " ; when she touched the
bowl, " my home is Lota, or the bowl." The closest analogy
to the present tale will, however, be found in the tale in
" The Arabian Nights " of " 'Aziz and 'Azizah ", 4 in which,
like the wife in this story, the love-lorn cousin of the
contemptible hero interprets for her husband the signs of
her rival. In the present tale, when the hero goes to the
assignation and falls asleep while he is waiting for the girl, he

is advised, when he goes a second time, to cut his finger, so
that the pain may keep him. awake. A good parallel to
this incident occurs in " Gul-i-Bakawali ", when the prince,
who is determined to keep awake in order that he may
not fail to meet Bakawall, cuts his finger and rubs ' salt
into the wound. 1

The final test of the faithful wife is that she is ready to
risk her honour in order to save that of her faithless husband
and his paramour. Sir G. Grierson remarks that another
version of the episodes in the garden, of the arrest of the
lovers, and of the defeat of the Chief Constable, will be
found in J. Hertel, Der Kluge Vizier, ein Kaschmirischen
Volksroman. 2 This episode assumes various forms. In
Somadeva's "Story of Saktimati", 3 Samudradatta is arrested
with another man's wife in the temple of the Yaksa,
Manibhadra, and both are placed in confinement. The wife
of Samudragupta, Saktimati, exchanges clothes with the
paramour of her husband, and allows them to escape. Similar
to this is the tale of "Mohammad the Shalabi, and his
Minister, and his Wife " in " The Arabian Nights ", in which
Mohammad takes the Qazl's daughter to a place outside the
city, where they are caught and imprisoned. Mohammad's
wife dresses herself as a youth, enters the prison, and gives
her clothes to the girl, who effects her escape. When
Mohammad and his wife protest that they have been wrong-
fully arrested, the king orders that the unfortunate Chief of
the Police shall be executed, his house plundered, and his
women enslaved. 4

VI. THE STORY OF YUSUF AND ZULAIKHA
This is the famous tale of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, one
of the cycles of great oriental love stories, represented by

" Yusuf and Zulaikha " by Abu'r- Rahman Jam! ; " Khusrau
and Shirin" by Nizamu'd-Dln, who was the author also of
" Majnun and Laila ". In the Qur'an 1 Zulaikha is wife of
Qitfir, or Potiphar, the ultimate source whence this tale and
that of the dream of Pharaoh are derived. 2 In the story
under consideration we have the familiar incident of the
Selection of a New King by an Elephant, for which, as
Sir G. Grierson points out, we have several parallels from
Kashmir. 3 In some of the Kashmir tales the hawk shares
the power of selection with the elephant. The fullest
discussion of the widespread incident is that by Dr. E. Sidney
Hartland. 4 Dr. Hartland adds : " I have also given examples
showing that in various places the choice of a king actually
depended on omens from animals. Thus, Bapa, the hero of
the Guhilots of Mewar, was selected as heir to the throne by
an elephant which put a garland round his neck, not once, but
thrice." 5 Selection of the heir by a cobra, which shields the
child from the sun by its extended hood, is common.
Colonel Tod gives several instances from Rajput traditions. 6
The Nagasias and Kharias of the Central Provinces tell similar
legends. 7 A legend from the French colony of Senegal-Niger
tells of a bird, a metamorphosed hero, who decides the succession
to the post of Chief Griot by taking up his abode with the
Griot who is to obtain promotion. 8 In a Nubian story a
blackbird decides the choice of a queen by settling on her head. 9
We have a good example in Somadeva : " In that country there
was an immemorial custom that an auspicious elephant was
driven about by the citizens, and anyone that he took up with
his trunk and placed on his back was anointed king." 10

VII. THE TALE OF THE REED-FLUTE
There is a close resemblance, which we may suppose can
hardly be accidental, between this personification of the flute
and one of the most poetical passages in the " Arabian Nights "
in the tale of " 'AH Nur-al-Din and Miriam, the Girdle Girl "?
"The girl took the bag from him and opening it shook it,
whereupon there fell thereout two-and-thirty pieces of wood,
which she fitted one into another, male into female and female
into male, till they became a polished lute of Indian workman-
ship. Then she uncovered her wrists, and laying the lute on
her lap bent over it with the bending of mother over babe and
swept the strings with her finger-tips, whereupon it moaned
and resounded, and after its old home yearned, and it
remembered the water that gave it drink, and the earth whence
it sprang, and wherein it grew, and it minded the carpenter
who cut it and the polisher who polished it, and the merchants
who made it their merchandise, and the ship that shipped it ;
and it cried and called aloud, and moaned and groaned ; and
it was as if she asked it of all these things, and it answered
her with the tongue of the case, reciting these couplets " â€” for
which reference must be made to Sir R. Burton's version, which,
though it may be accurate, can retain little of the music of the
original poetry.

VIII. THE TALE OF A KING
For the main story Sir G. Grierson refers to the Kashmir
stories of "The Two Brothers" and "The Four Princes". 2
The basis of the story is a moral apologue, enforcing the
need of caution, which is a commonplace in folk-tales, as in
the cycle of "The Seven Wazirs", "Haste in killing is a vile
thing, for 'tis a grave matter : the quick we can kill, but the
killed we cannot quicken, and needs must we look to the
end of affairs". 3 "Often procrastination serves to avert an
inauspicious measure," says Somadeva. 4

The tale diverges in various ways.

First, we have the " Potiphar's Wife " cycle, and that of
Phaedra and Hippolytus, with their numberless variants, in
which a vicious woman fabricates a false charge against her
continent stepson, or some other equally innocent person
who has the ill-luck to come into contact with her. In
Buddhist literature this appears in the tale of the love of
Asoka's queen for Kunala, son of her co-queen, Padmavatl.
On his refusal to accept her advances, the queen, to whom
her husband, the emperor, had offered any boon she chose,
asked to be allowed to assume roj^al power for seven days.
During this time she sent officers to Taksasila and had
Kunala blinded. He appeared before his father in the guise
of a lute-player, was recognized, and the queen was burnt to
death. 1 The same authority refers to the tale of Sarangdhara,
who rejected the advances of his stepmother, and when she
complained to the king, it was ordered that his limbs should
be cut off, and that he should be exposed to wild beasts,
a fate from which he was saved only by a miraculous Voice
from Heaven. 2

Then comes the incident of the king who slays his favourite
falcon who dashes the cup out of his hand as he is about to
drink the poisoned water. Canon J. A. MacCulloch kindly
informs me that there is a version in the Persian Bidpai
literature, in the Anwar-i-Suheli, 3 the reference to which has
been traced by Sir G. Grierson.

Sir G. Grierson also refers to two similar tales from Bengal,
one of the tale of a snake in the room of a wedded couple ;
the other, a full story, with tales of the three guardians, in
one of which a horse is substituted for the hawk. 4

Next, we have the well-known tale of the " Faithful Dog ",
best known in the story of Beddgelert. Sir G. Grierson notes

that it occurs in the Kashmir tale, "A Lach of Rupees for
a Bit of Advice " 1 ; and he quotes the following parallel from
Baluchistan : 2 " A shrine dedicated to a dog would be a bit of
an oddity anywhere, and something more than an oddity in
a Musalman country. Yet such a shrine is to be found
in the Kirthar hills. And this is the pious legend that
clings to it. Once upon a time there was a dog that changed
masters in a pledge for a loan. Now he had not spent many
days with his new master before thieves came at dead of
night and took off ever so much treasure. But he slunk
after the rogues and never let them out of his sight till he
had marked down the spot where they had buried the spoil.
And, on the morrow, he barked and he barked and made
such a to-do, there was nothing for it but for the master of
his house to follow him till he came to the spot where the
treasure was buried. Well, the owner was pleased enough to
get his goods back, as you may guess. And round the dog's
neck he tied a label whereon was writ in plain large letters
that the debt was discharged, and with that he sent him
packing to his old master. So the dog bounded off home, as
pleased as pleased could be. But his master was mighty angry
to see him, for he was an honest fellow, and much as he
loved his dog, he set more store on being a man of his word.
And as a warning to all breakers of pledges he hacked him
limb from limb. But when in the end he saw the label
round his neck, and heard all that he had done, he was
exceedingly sorry. So he gathered up the limbs and buried
them in a grave. Had the limbs been the limbs of a true
believer, and not the limbs of an unclean beast, he could not
have made more pother over the burial. And to the grave
of the faithful dog Jhalawan folk resort to this day. And
there they sacrifice sheep, and distribute the flesh in alms,
in the certain belief that whatsoever they seek, that they
will surely find."

In Western folklore the tale assumes various forms, the

earliest version appearing in Pausanias. 1 It appears in the
Gesta Romanorum, No. 26 (Herrtage, p. 98). In the Book of
Sindibdd it appears as the story of " The Snake and the Cat ",
the faithful cat killing the snake in the baby's cradle. 2 In
the Pancatantra 3 and Hitopadesa 4 it is a mungoose which
attacks the snake, and in Kalilah and Dimna a weasel.
Somadeva tells it in the form of the " Story of the Brahman
and the Mungoose ". 5

The account of the shrine erected to the faithful dog in
Baluchistan already quoted is not the only instance of worship
of this kind in India. In the Central Provinces the tale is
told of a Banjara who, after he killed his dog, "built a
temple to the dog's memory, which is called the Kukurra
Mandhl. And in this temple is the image of a dog. This
temple is in the Drug District, four miles from Balod.
A similar story is told of the temple of Kukurra Math in
Mandla." 6 A similar tale has been localized at Rohisa in
Kathiawar. When his master learned how basely he had
treated the faithful animal, " he wept bitterly and caused
the Chitrasar lake to be excavated, and built round at the
spot where the dog fell dead, and on the little island in
the lake he built a temple in which he placed his dog's
image, which is there to this day." 7 The tale has migrated
as far west as Ireland and as far east as China. 8

of Tobit, 1 in which, by the advice of Raphael, the devil is
scared by the stench of the burnt heart and liver of a fish.
Sir G. Grierson quotes a story from Bengal in which we
have a princess from whose body a snake issues. 2 It is
unnecessary to discuss this tale at length, because, as
Dr. E. Sidney Hartland reminds me, it has been examined,
with a full collection of parallels, by Mr. F. H. Groome. 3

XII. THE TALE OF THE AKHUN
Sir G. Grierson remarks that there is a somewhat similar
story in the Linguistic Survey of India, 4 of which the following
is a copy : " There was a Thakur who had nothing to eat in his
house, so he said to himself, ' Brother, I'm going to look for
service.' There was also a bird of omen, but though he went
every day she never gave him one. One day she went out to
pick up some food, and before she started she told her children
on no account to give an omen to anyone. While she was
away the Thakur came as usual, and the chicks gave him the
looked-for indication ; so he saddled his camel, mounted, and
set off.

Back came the omen-bird, and overtook the Thakur on his
way. She assumed the form of a woman. ' Who are you ? '
said he. ' I'm your wife.' ' Come along ; one has become two.'
So he took her up on his camel. They came to a tank full of
water, and he was compelled to descend for a certain purpose.
' I'll be back in a moment,' said he. * All right,' said she.
On the bank of the tank he saw a snake pursuing a frog.
' It's a shame to let the poor thing be killed,' said he. So he
took out his pen-knife and cut bits of flesh out of his thigh
with which he fed the snake till it could eat no more. Then
he got up and went back to his camel. His thigh was all
bloody.  What's happened ? ' said the omen-bird. ' A snake
was going to eat a frog, so I threw it lumps of flesh from my
thigh instead.' 5 Straightway, the omen-bird passed her hand

over the wound, and it healed as it was before. Then they
got up on the camel and went on their way."

Sir G. Grierson remarks : " This is the end of the extract.
The entire story, a long one, will be found on pp. 82 If. of
Mr. Macalister's Specimens} The frog takes the form of
a barber and overtakes the Thakur. The three then &o on.
The snake, out of gratitude for his good meal, also joins the
company as a Brahman. The four settle in a city, where
the omen-bird gets the Thakur service under the king, on
a salary of a lakh of rupees. The king's barber persuades the
king to set the Thakur three apparently impossible tasks (to
get a snake's jewel, to find a ring thrown into a well, and
to get news of his dead and gone ancestors), all of which the
Thakur performs with the aid of the snake, the frog, and the
omen-bird. To carry out the third task, the omen-bird assumes
the form of the Thakur, and gets the king to make a huge
funeral pyre, on which she sits. It is lighted, and she flies
away in the smoke. She then sends the Thakur to the king
with the news that he has come back from the king's ancestors
.and that they are all well, but want a barber. So the king
makes another pyre, and sets his barber on it to go off to his
ancestors. The pyre is lighted, and the barber is, of course,
burned to death, and the king and the Thakur live happy ever
afterwards." The tale belongs to the cycle of Friendly
Animals represented in the West by Perraults' famous version
of " Puss in Boots ". In this cycle the performance of
seemingly impossible tasks by the aid of helping animals is
common. 2

The tasks set in the tale now under consideration deserve
fuller treatment.

The incident of the ruby with a worm inside it appears
in three forms in the " Arabian Nights ". In the story of
" Ma'aruf the Cobbler and his wife Fatimah ", Ma'aruf , when
called on to examine a jewel, squeezes it between his thumb

and forefinger, and shows that it is " only a bittock of
mineral worth a thousand dinars. ' Why dost thou style it
a jewel ? ' " 1 Again, in the " Tale of the King who kenned
the Quintessence of Things ", the old man examines the jewels
brought for sale. He decides that one of them is of small
value, and the merchant asks : " How can this, which is bigger
of bulk and worthier for water and righter in rondure, be of
less value than that ? " The Shaikh decides that " in its
interior is a teredo, a boring worm ; but the other jewel is
sound and secure against breakage ". 2 Lastly, in the " Story
of Three Sharpers ", the sharper says, " An thou determine
upon the killing of yonder man, first break the gem, and if
thou find therein a worm, thou wilt know the wight's word
to have been veridical." The king smashes the gem with his
mace and finds a worm within it. 3

Further on, in the episode when the jeweller seizes the
garment of one of the girls as she is bathing, we have a
version of the Swan Maiden cycle, of which an early form
appears in the legend of Krishna when he takes the garments
of the Gopis as they are bathing in the Jumna. In many
cases of tales of this cycle the Swan Maiden is captured to-
be eventually married to the hero. Sometimes, as in the
present case, she is held to ransom. It is unnecessary to
discuss at length a cycle of tales which has been fully
investigated by Dr. E. Sidney Hartland and by others. 4
Again, we have the incident of the ruby emitting a brilliant
light, a lieu commun in Eastern and Western folk-tales. In
one of Somadeva's stories, " The Brave King Vikramaditya,"
the King Hemaprabha gives his daughter, Ratnaprabha, to
Naravahanadatta, with " glittering heaps of jewels, gleaming
like innumerable wedding fires ". 5

At every word the fairy Lalmal speaks a ruby drops, or
seven rubies fall daily from her mouth. In one of Somadeva's
tales Marubhuti eats two grains of rice from food in which
a child had been cooked, and thus gains the power of spitting
gold. On this Mr. Tawney remarks : " In ' Sagas from the
Far East' there is a story of a gold-spitting prince. In
Gonzenbach's ' Sicilianische Marchen ' Quaddaruni's sister drops
pearls and precious stones from her hair when she combs it
â€” Dr. Kohler in his note on this tale gives many European
parallels. In a Swedish story a gold ring falls from the
heroine's mouth whenever she speaks, and in a Norwegian
story gold coins. I may add to the parallels quoted by
Dr. Kohler, No. 36 in Coelho's ' Contos Portuguezes ', in which
tale pearls drop from the heroine's mouth." l

Lalmal, the fairy, gave the Lapidary her ring and said :
" Go thou again into the spring. Close by the side of it
thou wilt find a great rock. Show thou my ring unto that
rock, and it will arise and stand upright." We are reminded
of the wonder-working ring of Aladdin in the " Arabian
Nights". In a Kashmir tale, "The Charmed Ring," the
merchant's son speaks to the ring, and immediately a beautiful
house and a lovely woman with golden hair appeared. 2
Sulaiman, or Solomon, entrusts his seal ring, on which his
kingdom depends, to his concubine, Aminah. Sakhr, the JinnI,
transformed into the king's likeness, takes it, after which
Sulaiman is reduced to beggary. But after forty days the
JinnI fled, throwing the ring into the sea, where it was
swallowed by a fish, and eventually restored to its owner.
The tale is Talmudic, and there is a hint of it in the Qur'an. 3

In the tale of " Vinltamati who became a Holy Man ", in
Somadeva's Collection, the Yaksa gives the hero a ring which
averts all calamities known as iti, that is to say, excessive
rain, drought, locusts, birds, and injury by foreign invaders; 4

and in another tale, " &rldatta and Mrgankavatl," we have
a magic ring which counteracts the effects of poison. 1

The Lady of the Rock turns the Lapidary into a pebble.
Then her mother says : " Aha ! my girl, I smell the smell of
a mortal man " â€” the " Fee faw f urn " of " Jack, the Giant
Killer ", common in Marchen. The Italian demon, the Oreo, has
" a demonic acuteness of scent ; he can tell, like a sea-monster,
the approach of human flesh ". 2 The technical phrase in folk-
tales from the Indian plains is manush-gandha, " the smell
of man's flesh." In a Panjab story, the tale of " Lai Badshah,
the Red King ", the ogre cries, " I smell man's flesh, I smell
man's blood." 3 In a Bengal story the Raksasas cry : " How,
mow, khow ! A human being I smell," or " Hye, mye, khye ! "
with the same meaning. 4

This tale, it may be remarked, contains a version of the
Letter of Death. I have discussed this incident in connexion
with the story of Bellerophon. In the Homeric version : 5
" To Bellerophon the gods granted beauty and lovely man-
hood ; but Proitos, in his heart, devised evil for him, and
being mightier far drove him from the land of the Argives,
whom Z,eus had made subject to his sceptre. Now Proitos'
wife, goodly Anteia, lusted after him, to have converse in
secret love, but no whit prevailed she, for the uprightness
of his heart, on wise Bellerophon. Then spake she lyingly
to King Proitos: 'Die, Proitos, or else slay Bellerophon, that
would have converse in love with me against my will.' So
spake she, and anger got hold upon the king at that he heard.
To slay him he forbare, for his soul had shame at that ; but he
sent him to Lykia, and gave him tokens of woe, graving in
a folded tablet many deadly things, and bade him show these
to Anteia's father, that he might be slain." So the king of
Lykia imposed tasks upon him, and when he accomplished

them the king gave him his daughter in marriage and half of
all the honour of his kingdom. Dr. Sidney Hartland writes :
w Thucydides gives a similar story of Pausanias, Regent of
Sparta. The episode of Uriah the Hittite (2 Samuel xi, 14)
is another case. Shakespeare, drawing from Saxo Grammaticus
(lib. iii), employs it in 'Hamlet'. Walter Map {Be Nugis
Curialium, v, 4) recounts it of Count and Earl Godwin, but
leaves the tale half told. It may almost be said to be a
commonplace of folk-tales. It generally makes its appearance
in tales belonging to the cycle of ' The Man born to be a King '."
To this some oriental examples may be added. In Somadeva's
" Story of Sivavarman " the king writes a letter to a neigh-
bouring chief, asking him to slay his minister, Sivavarman.
He escapes by announcing that God will not send rain for
twelve years on that land in which he is slain. 1 In the
Kashmir story of " The Ogress Queen " the queen writes
a letter to her grandmother, a RaksasI, telling her to kill the
lad, but a faqir reads it and tears it up. 2 In the Panjab story
of " The Son of Seven Mothers " the queen gives the lad
a piece of a broken potsherd, with these words inscribed on it :
" Kill the bearer at once, and sprinkle his blood like water."
It is read and altered by the hero's wife. 3 In the Bengal story
of " The Boy whom Seven Mothers suckled ", the RaksasI queen
sends the boy to her mother with a letter requesting her to
devour him the moment he delivers the letter. 4 We have the
same incident in " Brave Hiralalbase " and in " The Demon and
the King's Son " in the collection of Miss Maive Stokes. 5
Similar to this is the action of the Sultan in the story of
" Ahmed the Orphan". 6 In Arabic folklore such letters are
so common that they are known as " the letters of Mutalammis ",
one of the intended victims of the trick. 7

the " Letter of Death " tale in the Bkakta-mala, 1 in which
Dhrstabuddhi gives a letter to Candrahasa, saying, " Take thou
this to my house and give this letter into the hands of my son
Madana, and say unto him, ' Prithee carry out what is written
therein.' " But Candrahasa falls asleep in a garden where
comes to sport with her damsels and her fellow-maidens the
daughter of Dhrstabuddhi. " By chance she saw Candrahasa
as he slept, and love for him entered her heart. So she led her
companions away, and then leaving them she returned by
another path and gazed enraptured at his beauty. In her
yearning she saw by him a letter, with her brother's name
upon it. She took it up and read it, and therein was written,
 At once give thou poison (visa) to the one that beareth this
letter. Delay thou not in this, or dread my anger.' When she
read these words, wroth was she with her father, and filled
with pity was she for the youth. Now the damsel's name was
Visaya. Ink made she with the collyrium of her eyes, and
after the word visa, poison, added she but one little syllable
yd, so that visa became visaya." So Visaya was married to
Candrahasa, and the plot laid by the vile Dhrstabuddhi came
to naught.

We have here also a version of " Jack and the Beanstalk ",
fully discussed by Canon J. A. MacCulloch, who points out the
connexion between mythology and folklore, where "a primitive
mythological way of regarding the universe has suggested and
given rise to the chief incident of one of our well-known
nursery tales". 2

On the question of eating the leathern peas ; Dr. Sidney

Hartland writes : " It may be suspected that the real reason

why the hero is forbidden to eat the leathern peas is, not that

they are indigestible, but that to do so would be to eat the

food of supernatural beings, and so unite himself with them

permanently ; he might not be able to return ; he would become

one of them. I have considered elsewhere similar incidents. 3

A full discussion of the matter would be very lengthy, and

When the hero marries the lady, she directs him to ask only
for the skin mat, known as the Flying Couch. We may
compare this with the flying horses of the " Arabian Nights ". 1
In the Bengali tales the heroine is carried through the air by
two birds, and a club and rope carry people across the ocean. 2

Brahma, in the Hindu mythology, gives Kuvera the great
self-moving car, called Puspaka. 3 We met with flying chariots
and similar magical vehicles in the tales of Somadeva. 4 The
closest parallel to the incident under consideration is the Flying
Carpet of the tale of " Prince Ahmad and the Fairy Peri-Banou "
of the " Arabian Nights ". 5

ON THE LANGUAGE USED IN THE TALES

As regards the text of these tales recorded by Govinda Kaula,
it is, so far as its contents and wording go, in every way worthy
of the reputation of that excellent scholar. But the spelling of
the words is that customary among Kashmiri Pandits, and is
based on no fixed system. These persons have no certain rules
for representing the broken vowel sounds that form a prominent
feature of the language, and Govinda Kaula, each time that
a word containing one of these sounds recurred, spelt it as the
spirit moved him at the time. A few examples will suffice. The
word poda, manifest, is written t^ in ii, 1, and TfT^r in iii, 8 ;
korun, he made, is written W^ in iv, 6, but ^J^Â«^ in vii, 4,
although he writes efi^t m the vei T nex ^ ^ me '> ^ u * ne was > * s
written "^m in ii, 4, but ITR^ and tSTPEJ in ii, 5. It is evident
that to reproduce such spelling would render this work of little

use to any person not perfectly familiar with the language, and
would greatly complicate the preparation of any index or
vocabulary.

A uniform system of spelling Kashmiri in the Nagarl character
was devised by the late Pandit Isvara Kaula, and was used by
him in his KaSmlrasabddmrta, or Kashmiri Grammar in the
Sanskrit language, which has been published by the Asiatic
Society of Bengal. Although not perfect, this system has the
merit of being an attempt to represent each sound in the
language by one character, and by one character only. With
a few minor alterations, it has been followed by me in
various works on Kashmiri, such as my Essays on Kdgmlri
Grammar, my Manual of the Kashmiri Language, and the Kiishmlrl-
English Dictionary in course of publication by the Asiatic
Society of Bengal, and it is now, I believe, generally accepted by
European scholars.

In preparing the transliterated version of Govinda Kaula's
text I have therefore first copied the latter, spelling the words
according to Isvara Kaula's system, and have then rigidly
transliterated that into the Eoman character. It must be clearly
understood that this process has in no way altered the real text
in any way. If Isvara Kaula were to read out the text written
according to his system, and if Govinda Kaula were to read out
what he himself had written, the resultant sounds would in every
case be identical. The change has been one of spelling, and of
nothing else ; in other words, it has been merely a change from
unsystematic to systematic spelling.

My text in the Eoman character can at once be mechanically
converted into the Nilgarl character according to Isvara Kaula's
system of spelling by the aid of the following table and
appended instructions : â€”

^ a, ^IT a, ^ i, t h ^ w, ^M^ ai , *ft o, ^sft au.

T(pa, mp/ia, ^ ba, ?? ma,
H ye, X ra t *T la, ^ ra, tea,
^ she, *T 8a, f ha.
It will be observed that the above agrees with the ordinary
system of transliterating Nagarl, with the following exceptions : â€”

(1) Kashmiri possesses no sonant aspirates.

(2) The letters \g: and HJ" are each used only as a member
of a conjunct consonant before a letter of its own class, as in
^ nka, ^ nkha, ^ nga, "C^T nta, TQ ntha, T^J ncla. Under these
circumstances I have not thought it necessary to add in either
case a diacritical mark to the n, more especially because, in
the Persian character, if, xjf, and Â«^ are all represented by ^.

(3) After the letters "5J, ^, and If, the letter a is always
pronounced e. Hence, I have transliterated them tie, ye, and
she respectively. For IJ" I use she instead of se ; as in
Kashmiri the sound of this letter is the same as that of the
Persian *. The letter not only represents a Persian *,
but also the Indian 1[ and Xf, the sound of all three having been
conflated into one sound, that of the English sh in " shell ".
Kashmiri possesses no cerebral sibilant, although in Kashmiri
MSS. we sometimes find the letter isf. This, however, is only
Pandits' affectation, who pretend that they ought to write TJVs ,
not xftlj, a flower, because there is a tf in the Sanskrit J^l^.

(4) Attention may be called to the affricative letters ^ tsa,
TÂ£ tsha, and 5f za. The letter tsha is the aspirate of tsa, i.e. it is
pronounced as in " cat's head" and not as in " cat-shark ".

(5) The short vowels e (except in the cases of fie, ye, and slit)
and 6 are represented by Jf and ^ respectively. They never
commence a syllable. In other words, when ^ and ^ follow
a consonant they are pronounced e and o respectively. Thus
^ is he, not Jcye, and g? is Jed, not kica. Some Kashmiris,

INTRODUCTION li

As explained in the Kashmiri Manual, the sounds of e and 6
are not affected by i-mafra, and hence, in this case, no diacritical
marks are given to them in the Roman character, although they
are marked as aprasiddha in the Nilgarl character.

As regards Sir Aurel Stein's system of presenting the sounds
uttered by Hatim, it is, of course, consistent with itself. Each
letter employed by him represents one sound and one sound only,
and each sound is represented by one letter and by one letter
only. His system, however, is not the same as mine, and he
authorized me, in preparing his materials for the press, to alter
it to agree with mine, so long as the alteration was consistent.
For instance, I was authorized to alter his & to my 6, provided
that this was always done, that a was never altered to any other
letter, and that no other of his letters was also altered to 6.

His system of arranging consonants presented no difficulty.
It is practically the same as mine, and only one or two changes
were necessary. These are as follows. The fricative sound
resembling that of an English ts is represented in my system by
ts and in his by ts. The sound which corresponds to that of the

Persian <Â£, and which in Nagarl is written ^J, is written s by

Sir Aurel Stein and sh by me. I have throughout altered his
ts to ts and s to sh. Similarly, the sound represented by the
Persian * is written z by Sir Aurel Stein, and, for the sake of

uniformity, I have altered it to zh, although the sound is not
heard in Srlnagar Kashmiri or, consequently, found in Govinda
Kaula's transcript.

The labial semi- vowel in Kashmiri is a pure bi-labial, and not
a dento -labial. Its sound is neither that of v or that of iv, but
something between both, sometimes, especially before palatal
vowels, tending towards a ^-sound, and sometimes, especially
before a and before labial vowels, tending towards a w-sound.
In my system I use both v and w for its representation,
endeavouring so far as was possible to indicate the shade of
sound to which, in my experience, it approximates. Sir Aurel
Stein represents the labial semi-vowel uniformly by v, without
regard to its exact shade of sound. I have not ventured to
interfere with this, and have left his v's unchanged throughout.



lii KASHMIBI STORIES AND SONGS

Possibly his i and u are also semi-vowels, but the matter is
doubtful, and will be referred to again under the head of vowels.

It thus follows that, so far as the representation of con-
sonants is concerned, the systems of transcription employed in
the printed version of Sir Aurel Stein's copy of Hatim's text
and in my copy of Govinda Kaula's text are, with the exception
of the representation of the labial semi-vowel, identical.

Turning to the representation of vowel-sounds, it might
appear that the matter is equally simple. I thought so myself
at first, and commenced transcribing his text with the altera-
tions necessary to make it agree with my system. But before
long I found that this was an impossible task. The range of
vowel-sounds used by Hatim is not the same as that used in
the Srinagar Kashmiri, w r ith which alone I am familiar. Hatim
has sounds, such as the a in " cancelled " (Sir Aurel's a, my a),
which so far as I am aware occurs only rarely in Srinagar
Kashmiri, and then only in monosyllables ending in an
aspirated surd â€” e.g. in the Hindu pronunciation of krakh,
a noise, but not in the plural JcraJca. Again, on the other
hand, Srinagar Kashmiri has two short o's â€” one, the first o in
the English word " promote ", which I represent by o, and the
other the o in " hot ", which I represent by 6. Sir Aurel Stein's
system knows only the latter of these, which he represents
by o. There are numerous other differences and cross divisions
in the two systems, and a thorough examination of the whole
of Hatim's text gives the following results : â€”

On the one hand, some of Hatim's sounds have their exact
equivalent in the Srinagar Kashmiri known to me. These are
the a in " America ", the a in " father ", the ai in " aisle ", the
e in " met ", the e like the a in " vale ", the o in " open ", the
u in "put", the u in "rule", the 11 in the German "Kiirze",
and the peculiar Kashmiri d, for which, so far as I am aware,
there is no equivalent in any European language. In all these
our transcriptions agree, except that Sir Aurel represents the
e in " met " by e, while I use e. On the other hand, there is
the greatest confusion between the two systems in their repre-
sentation of the broken vowels, which play so important a role



INTRODUCTION liii

in Kashmiri pronunciation. One example will suffice. There
is a modified a, which Sir Aurel Stein represents by a, and
which he says is sounded like the u in " rut " prolonged. In
Srlnagar Kashmiri the sound strikes my ear rather as a pro-
longed German 6, although many Pandits, in certain words,
sound it almost like the o in " note ",* and I represent it by 6.
So far the matter is comparatively simple, and it might be
possible to solve the problem of the two competing tran-
scriptions ; but the case is complicated by the fact that this
same modified a almost equally often has an altogether
different sound â€” that of the aw in " awful " â€” which Sir Aurel
represents by a, and which I represent by 6. This may occur
in the same word when it occurs more than once. For instance,
the word which I always transliterate as poda, and which
means " manifest ", was sounded by Hatim as pada in ii, 1, and
as pada in iii, 8. At other times it was sounded as 6, here
following the example of the Pandits to which I have just
alluded. Thus my moj^, a mother, is Hatim's moj in viii, 3,
but maj in viii, 1. It is evident that it would be impossible
to arrange any system of transcription such as mine, which is
based on the Nagarl spelling of Kashmiri Pandits, so as to
agree with a pronunciation varying so greatly as in the above
examples. I have therefore decided to leavf Sir Aurel Stein's
representation of the vowel-sounds untouched, and to print it
exactly as it stands. This will give rise to inconvenience in
comparing the two texts, but it is better that this inconvenience
should occur than that any attempted alterations of mine
should obscure the niceties of Hatim's pronunciation.

The following is the system employed by Sir Aurel Stein in
representing the vowel-sounds used by Hatim : â€”

A few remarks may be made upon the above.

The so-called ma^ra- vowels are, as in my system, represented
by small letters aÂ£>ove the line. Thus a , *, u . Sir Aurel Stein
remarks about each of them that it is " very short, but quite
audible ". As a rule, in Srlnagar Kashmiri, this is true of
a and *, but to my ear a final u is hardly audible, if audible at
all. Pandits tell me that they can hear it, but I have only
occasionally been able to do so. This seems also to have been
Sir Aurel Stein's experience. It is evident that what is meant
by his statement that u is quite audible is that he has written
it when it was audible and has not written it when it was not
audible. A reference to the index of words arranged according
to their final letters will show that there are hundreds of
words ending in u in which he did not hear that letter, and
consequently did not write it. ( The cases in which he did hear
it are comparatively few. Such are bdguk u (iii, 9) and vot u mot
(vii, 29). The inaudibility of this letter is well illustrated by



INTRODUCTION lv

words such as my amyuk u , which becomes in Hatim's
mouth am v uk or amyuk in iii, 4, and atrnPuk in xii,
17 ; and my dop u , which is represented not only by dop u
(ii, 4; xi, 12), but also by dop (v, 9; viii, 1, 13; etc.), dup
(xi, 2, 14; xii, 4), and even dup? (xi, 11). It is unnecessary
to multiply examples. Many more will be found in the
indexes, and it is sufficient to state here that, like me,
Sir Aurel Stein has found that u-matra is very rarely audible.

Regarding the sound represented by du, Sir Aurel Stein
says that it is practically a diphthong au, like the ou in
" sound ", but is sometimes heard as a with a semi-liquid v.
As it struck me that possibly this u might be the equivalent
of my w, I referred the point to Sir Aurel, and he wrote as
follows in reply : â€”

" As regards gaii, I am now certain that I do not mean w
by the special u, but merely wished to indicate that the sound
was not a usual diphthong. Hatim always keeps the pre-
ceding long a [in du] quite clear of the u. This is all I wish
to indicate by the marks I employed. It may be the semi-
vowel v, but, in that case, it is exceedingly liquid." It will
be observed that, as in gau above quoted, the u does not
necessarily follow a long a. Sir Aurel also occasionally writes
an i, to which the same remarks apply.

The Kashmiri of these tales, as recorded by Pandit Govinda
Kaula, is practically the same as that described by Pandit
Isvara Kaula in his Kashmiri grammar entitled the Kasmira-
sabddmrta, 1 and by the present writer in his Essays on
Kdgmiri Grammar and in his Kashmiri Manual. There are,
however, a few instances in which there occur forms not
authorized by any of these works. Some of these are described
as " village forms ", i.e. as not used in the city of Srinagar,
and hence by purists banned from literary Kashmiri. Others
are idioms peculiar to the Musalman dialect, Hatim, the
narrator, being, of course, a follower of Islam ; while a few

1 Published by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in the Bibliotheca Indica.



lvi KASHMIRI STORIES AND SONGS

others are additional forms allowed in Srinagar, but not
recorded by Isvara Kaula.

As regards vocabulary, there are two unusual words which
I have not met elsewhere. One of these is ration, to cause to
seize, which is not in Isvara Kaula's very full Dhatupatha.
It is the causal of the verb ratun, which is of frequent
occurrence. The other is the word givdsh, instead of gash, the
light of dawn, which occurs three times, and is therefore not
a slip of the transcriber. The usual negative particle is the
standard na, not ; but nu occurs once, and a poetical
equivalent is nan.

In Persian the words shah and padsliah, a king, sometimes
appear with the a of the final syllable shortened, so that we
also find shah and padsliah. The same is the case when these
words are borrowed in the language of these tales, though,
under the ordinary Kashmiri rule, a short a after sh becomes
e, so that we get both shah and sheh (in shahmar or shehmar,
a python) and patashah and patasheh. In the second word it
will be observed that, as is frequent in borrowed words, the
Paisaci Prakrit rule of hardening the sonant d to t is followed.
On the other hand, Sir Aurel Stein always writes the word
padshah or padshah with a d. From this we gather that
while Hatim, like a good Musalman, adhered to the original
borrowed form of the word, Govinda Kaula wrote the word as
he was accustomed to hear it in the standard Hindu Kashmiri
of Srinagar.

As regards the vowel-sounds, Govinda Kaula almost always
indicates the same sounds as those recorded by Isvara Kaula.
According to the latter there is an important group of nouns
ending in a r which indicate professions (iv, 99), such as
rang a r, a dyer; son a r, a goldsmith; man a r, a lapidary, and
so on. The only noun of this group occurring in the Tales is
son a r, a goldsmith, and this G.K. persistently writes sonar,
with a full a. In Kashmiri, when the vowel of a monosyllable
is a followed by an aspirated surd consonant, the a takes the
sound of the a in the English word "hat" (Essays, p. 6).
Govinda Kaula attempts to represent this sound in the word



INTRODUCTION lvii

krakh, outcry, by e, and writes krekh. Possibly this represents
a real variation of pronunciation. In villages d followed by
i-matra is often pronounced i. G.K. has reproduced this in
one instance in the word pandn i (iv, 7), which he here writes
panin, and which Sir Aurel Stein represents by pan v en.
Another instance of village pronunciation recorded by G.K. is
the substitution of a for u in tshanandwun for tshunandwun,
to cause to cast (x, 13).

In the Kashmiri of Isvara Kaula the sound represented by
o is changed to il before i-matra, i, or y. Thus from hod,
imprisonment, we have Jcild i , a prisoner, with a dative singular
kildis. G.K. never indicates this last change. Thus he writes
kod 1 , kodis ; soty or sotin for silty or siltin, with ; pontsyum u
for piintsyum u , fifth.

As regards consonants we may first note that in the villages
the letters d and r are frequently interchanged. This r is
a dental letter, as elsewhere on the North-West Frontier. We
see this clearly in words like khdlun or khdrun, to mount ;
wdlun or wdrun, to bring down, in which r is in standard
Kashmiri interchangeable with a dental I. We thus find that
in the villages there is free interchange between a cerebral
d and a dental r, which could not take place were it not that,
as in all Dardic languages, in the common village talk of
Kashmir there is a weak feeling of the difference between
cerebrals and dentals. We shall see that in Hatim's pro-
nunciation this want of differentiation between these two
classes of sounds is remarkably evident. Govinda Kaula's
spelling is more influenced by his literary training and
familiarity with Sanskrit, but even he reproduces the inter-
change of d and r in several instances, such as larun or
ladun, to pursue ; kur u or kud u , a daughter ; mor u or mod u ,
the body ; thilr il -kani or thudP-kani, backwards ; tshddun or
tshdrun, to seek. In all these the standard form sanctioned
by Isvara Kaula is the first of each pair. The examples l mor u
and mod u are very instructive. G.K. gives both forms, and
so does Sir Aurel Stein in his transcription, but the two do not
always agree. Where G.K. has d Sir Aurel often has r, and



lviii KASHMIRI' STORIES AND SONGS

vice versa. This illustrates how nearly akin these two letters
were as they issued from Hatim's mouth.

The pronunciation of the Persian letter j zdl in borrowed
words varies. Sometimes we have z as kdkaz, paper, and
sometimes d as in Jcdlcad, paper, and gudarun, to happen.

There are two occurrences of the aspiration of a non-final
consonant, viz. hatha for bdta, words (xii, 25), and thoth u for
toth u , beloved (vii, 4). There are no other instances of such
aspiration or disaspiration, although Sir Aurel's transcription
teems with both. We have a solitary instance of the insertion
of w in the word gwdsh for gash, already mentioned. It is
probably connected with the Sanskrit Jcdsa-.

In the declension of nouns there are a few examples of
departure from the rules laid down by Isvara Kaula.
According to him the suffix of the indefinite article is ah, as in
kdldh, a time. Musalmans drop the h and write kdld. G.K.
writes the article in each way with about equal frequency.
A list of occurrences will be found in the vocabulary under
the article ah, a. This is, however, rather a matter of spelling
than one of pronunciation, as the h of ah is hd-e mukhtafi.

The singular agent of the first declension ends in -an, as in
tsiiran, by a thief. The word sonar (for son a r), a goldsmith,
belongs to this declension, but in the one instance in which
the agent of this word occurs (v, 4) it is sonar, i.e. the same
as the nominative. Sir Aurel Stein's transcription shows that
this is not a slip on the part of Govinda Kaula, and there can
be no doubt that the mistake (if mistake it be and not
a dialectic form) was made by Hatim.

According to the rule laid down by I.K. the suffix un u of
the genitive can be used only with nouns that are masculine
proper names. But in poetry its use is more extended, and
hence in xi, 13 we have sapharun u , of a journey. More
directly contrary to the rule is the phrase as\i e hun u tab, the
fever of love, in v, 10, a prose passage.

According to I.K. the plural agent of the first and fourth
declensions ends in -an, and of the second and third de-
clensions in -yau. G.K. very often writes these -av and -iv



INTRODUCTION lix

respectively. In my opinion these are merely two different
ways of recording the same sound, one that it is difficult to
represent in the Nagari character. Elsewhere in Kashmiri
the diphthong au is at the present day pronounced exactly
like o, and is, in fact, a superfluous letter. But in the plural
agent the u of au is almost consonantal. Perhaps w would
represent its sound better than u, but aw could not represent
the sound of the au. Sir Aurel Stein generally writes this
diphthong au, and this is probably the best way of repre-
senting the sound. In Kashmiri the sound of ^ is something
between a labial (not a dento-labial) v and a labial w, some-
times tending more to one and sometimes tending more to the
other, and accordingly I myself sometimes transliterate it v
and sometimes w, a confessedly inaccurate, if convenient,
method. The following are examples of the use of -av by
G.K. : asmdnav, doyav, khabarddrav, malakav, nawav, nazar-
bdzav, phakirav, pirav, satav, tsorav, tsurav, yimav, zaminav.
These all belong to the first or fourth declension. For the
third declension we have modariv, zaniv. In one instance
(x, 1) G.K. gives, in a conversation in the colloquial style,
yimov for what I.K. would write as yimau, and this probably
represents the pronunciation as nearly as the Nagari character
(fsjjft"^) will permit. The above list is not complete, but on
the other hand it must be understood that there are numerous
examples of the more usual spelling with au and yau.

The postpositions used are those commonly employed.
Reference has already been made to the use of soty and sotin
for sUty and siltin. The word peth means " on ", and petha
"from on", but in x, 3 and x, 10 petha is exceptionally
employed with the meaning of peth.

As regards pronouns, the proximate demonstrative pronoun
yih, this, has a masculine form in the nominative singular,
yuh (xii, 5) or yuh (ii, 9, 11 ; x, 12). In xii, 5 yuh, as masculine,
is opposed to yih as feminine. Yih, of course, is also used in
the masculine. These masculine forms yuh and yuh are not
mentioned by I.K. There are a number of emphatic forms,
viz. yihoy, yihuy, yuhuy, yohay, yuhay (all masc.) ; yihay



lx KASHMIRI STORIES AND SONGS

(fern.) ; and various inanimate emphatic forms such as yiy,
yiy, and yi. None of these are mentioned by I.K.

The defective pronoun noth, nomis, appears under the form
nemis for the animate dative singular (v, 9 ; xii, 15). The
other forms used (nom, noman, nomav) all have 6. The
relative pronoun has its nom. sing. fern, yesa instead of I.K.'s
yossa. Similarly the interrogative pronoun has its nom. sing,
fern, kusa instead of kossa. Its inanimate dative singular is
the regular form hath, with a colloquial form katho (xi, 11).

The indefinite pronoun keh, anything, is pronounced keh by
Musalmans, and this is followed by Hatim. Similarly we
have the Musalman kentshdh for kentshdh, anything. There is
a nom. plur. masc. keh* which is not given by I.K.

The verb substantive is conjugated regularly. In two cases,
apparently under the influence of a neighbouring y, u has
been changed to e, so that a masculine form appears under
a feminine guise. These are cheyey for chuyey, if there is to
thee (ix, 6), and chey for chuy, he is verily (xii, 6). In one
case os i , they were, is changed to osi, metri gratia.

In the standard dialect the 2nd person singular of the
imperative is the same in form as the root. Thus kar, make
thou. But if a pronominal suffix is added, u is inserted as
a junction-vowel, as in karu-n, make thou him. The explana-
tion of this is that the 2nd singular imperative originally
ended in u (as in *karu), and that this u has been dropped in
the modern language. We have a survival of the old form in
gatshu, go thou (xi, 11). To this also must be referred the
forms khyuh (x, 5) and khyo (x, 12), eat thou. These represent
the modern kheh and an older *khehu. The 2nd person plural
imperative of trdwun, to let go, is troviv. In x, 5 we have
a variant trovyuv. This is hardly more than a variation of
spelling.

In the past conditional the Hindu &rlnagar dialect makes
the 1st person singular end in ho (e.g. karaho) and the 3rd
person singular in he (karihe). Musalmans shorten these final
syllables to ha and he respectively. G.K.'s transcription
generally, but not always, follows the Musalman idiom. Thus,



INTRODUCTION lxi

while we have karaho (viii, 11), we have also wuchaha
(viii, 10), I should have seen ; mdraha-th (ii, 11), I should kill
thee ; wuchaha-n (ii, 5), I would see it. So, for the 3rd
person, we have tsdrihe (vi, 14), he might pick out ; and
shubiheh (xii, 5), she would have been beautiful. The final
h in the last is hd-8 m ukhtafl.

In the past tenses we have, for the first past, the irregular
piirun, he put on (clothes), from pairun. For the second past
and other pasts in ov there is a strong tendency to weaken
the ov by the substitution of a short vowel. Thus gudariv
(v, 9), it happened, for guzaryov ; gav (iii, 1), he went, for
gauv ; khev (ii, 2), eaten, for khyauv ; pev (viii, 9), he fell,
for pyauv. Similarly, for the plural, we have khey (x, 2),
they were eaten, for khyey ; niy (v. 9), they were taken, for
niy. In h a reyekh (x, 5), for h a ryeyekh, it (fern.) remained
over and above for them, the omission of the first y is merely
a matter of spelling, as a long e is commonly pronounced as if
a y preceded it.

There is a similar shortening in the perfect participle, as in
gamot u (viii, 1, etc.), gone, for go r mot u \ mumot u (ii, 4, etc.),
dead, for miimot u ; pemot u (viii, 9), fallen, for pyb~mot u .

In the extremely village style of story xi we find the suffix
of the k u genitive, instead of the usual suffix mot u , added to
the past participle in order to convert it into an adjective.
This is quite common in the Western Pahari language spoken
immediately to the south-east. The examples are thov^k*,
stationed, and nyov 1 !^, dispatched (both nom. plur. masc.)
(xi, 6), for thov i -mdt i and nybvt-mat 1 respectively.

There is an irregular form of the conjunctive participle in
the same poem. It is kdrHhan (xi, 10), having made, in place
of the standard karith.

There are several variations in the forms of the pronominal
suffixes added to verbs. Thus we have mokalawahun (x, 1)
for mokaldwon {mokaldwaw -f ri), we shall complete it. The
suffix wa of the 2nd person plural very often drops the final a,
as in kheyev for kheyewa, it (fern.) was -eaten by you (x, 12) ;
karemav for karem a wa, they (fern.) were made by me for you



lxii KASHMIRI STORIES AND SONGS

(x, 6). This suffix is sometimes used in a very idiomatic sense,
like the corresponding Panjabi singular suffix je. It adds no
meaning directly to the verb, but, as it were, adds the idea of
" I say to you " to the whole sentence. Thus bani, it will
become, bani-v, (I say to you) it will become (ii, 7); dima-v,
(I say to you) I will give (ii, 8) ; tsali-v, (I say to you) he will
escape (ii, 8). Village forms using the suffix of this person in
its full form are wanamowa for wana-wa, I will say to you
(x, 1,2), and wanemowa for wanem a wa, they (fem.) were said
by me to you (x, 1). I am informed that an alternative village
form for wanamowa (wanawa) is wanowa.

Instead of karukh, make thou them, we have (xii, 19)
karuhulch.

Before discussing the details of Hatim's pronunciation as
illustrated by Sir Aurel Stein's transcription, it will be well to
mention a few general facts.

Words are frequently wrongly divided. Thus the word
amis u y â€” which is amis, to him, combined with the emphatic
suffix y, to which u-matra has been added as a junction-vowel
â€” is invariably divided before the s, so that we get am 1 say,
Â«m* sily, or some such form. So anehas, they brought (anekh)
to him (as), is written anye has ; the corrupt Arabic aslama-
laikum, may the peace be upon you, is written asld malaikum ;
bbg a remay, I divided (bog a rem) verily (ay), is written bage
remai ; and so on for hundreds of examples. On the other
hand, two words are sometimes contracted into one, as in
boh<*sa for boh hasa, I, Sir ; bebindqir 1 for bebi andar u y, within
the breastcloth; and chetal for cheh tal, she is below. In
reproducing Sir Aurel Steins text I have carefully allowed
these seeming irregularities to stand. The frequency with
which they occur, and the systematic way in which they are,
recorded, show that they are not slips of the pen, but represent
the actual manner in which Hatim, who, of course, knew
nothing of Kashmiri grammar, pronounced the words. To
him amis^y was two words â€” ami and s*y â€” and so on for the
others. We thus have a valuable illustration of how languages



INTRODUCTION lxiii

change in the mouths of their speakers, and how dialectic
variations and different stages of language take their rise.

Reference may also be made to one particular word â€” that
for " king ", which Sir Aurel Stein invariably records as
pddsJidJi, with a d, while Govinda Kaula equally invariably
records it as pdtashdh, with a t. Hatim was a follower of
Islam, and apparently pronounced this borrowed Persian word
in the form in which it was delivered to his language, while
Govinda Kaula, a Brahman affected by no Musalman prejudices,
wrote the word as it is pronounced in Srlnagar, with the
typical Pisaca change of d to t.

Turning to the vowel a, we find that it is occasionally
interchanged with a-matra in an unaccented syllable. Thus
we have both be bahd and beb a ha, priceless, and mahala Jean
and maJiHaJcJidn, for G.K.'s mahalakhdn, the harem of a
palace. Much more common is the interchange of a and a,
as in bdgas and bdgas, G.K. bdgas, to a garden ; dalila and
dalUa, G.K. dalild, sl story ; dar and dar, G.K. dar, in ;
sauddgar and sauddgar, G.K. -gar, a merchant ; zandna and
zandna, G.K. zandna, a woman ; and many others. Very
similarly we have the interchange of a or a with a-matra, as
in jdnavdr and jan^vdr, G.K. jdndwdr, a bird ; Jchabar and
Jchabar, G.K. Jchabar, news ; Jcdvandas, Jcdvandas, Jcdvandas,
khdv^ndas, and JcJidvandas, G.K. Jchdivandas, to a husband ;
halamas and Jtal^mas, G.K. Jialamas, to a skirt ; and nidre-
vdtalan and mdravdttlan, to executioners.

The sounds a and e seem to be absolutely convertible. Thus
we have ad?, ada, ad e , and ade for G.K.'s ada, then ; ana and
dne for G.K.'s ona, a mirror ; cJia and cJie for G.K.'s cJieJi, she
is ; cJias and ches for G.K.'s cJies, I (fern.) am ; daJdie ndvdn
for G.K.'s daJcJiandwdn, leaning upon ; gud a , gud?, guda, and
gude for G.K.'s goda, at first ; Jiasa and hase for G.K.'s Jiasa,
Sir ; Jidv^nam (G.K. hawanam), they will show to me, and vale
nam (G.K. wdlanam), they will cause me to descend, both in the
same line ; Jiazrat, Jiazrat 1 , JiazraH 1 , Iidzret, and hazret*, all for
G.K.'s Jiazrat-i, a certain title ; jdya and jdye, G.K. jdye, in a
place, in two consecutive lines, also jai and jay e ; kata, JcatJia,



lxiv KASHMIRI STORIES AND SONGS

and kathe, G.K. hatha, words ; 1st persons singular future, such
as para, I shall recite ; but behe, I shall sit, hare, I shall do ; kal*,
kala, and kale, G.K. kola, a head ; Icartg and karte, G.K. karta,
please do ; mar?vatalan, mar^vatelan, maravdtrtan, mare-
vatHan, marevatalan, etc., G.K. mdrawdtalan, to executioners ;
peta, pyete, etc., G.K. petha, from on ; yil?, yela, and yele, G.K.
yela, from restraint ; and hundreds of others.

When a precedes i it is usually written a, as in ralit, G.K.
ratith, having seized. Sometimes it is written a*, as in am 1 or
gtm*, G.K. dm*, by him. It becomes a* in Wr 1 , G.K. iaW, at
the side, and in one instance we have o, in maris or modis, to
a body. The change of a to o, but without a following i, occurs
in doh, doha, doha, dohÂ°, or doho, G.K. doha, on a day.

Other less common changes are the following. We have in
one case a lengthened to a, in khabardarau, by the watchmen
(elsewhere kha-). Cf. la l r l above. We have unaccented a-
matra becoming i-matra in asanas or asanas, G.K. asanas, for
being. In the word tulari, for G.K. t a l a ri, by a bee, a-matra
appears as u.

In standard Kashmiri, after sh, a is pronounced as e, and
I have in such a case transliterated it by that letter. Thus
the Persian shahr, a city, is in my transliteration of G.K.'s
text shown as shehar. As a rule Hatim preserves the a, but
there are also several instances of the change to e. Thus â€”

Sir Aurel Stein's transcription
My transliteration of G.K. of Hatim.

sheh, six, she,

shehara, from a city, shahtra and shehera,

sheharah, a city, shehra,

sherikh, a partner, sherik,

and others. The number would be increased if we included
several words that Hatim pronounced with a (it being
remembered that a and e are with him interchangeable), as
in shahan for G.K. stehan, to the six ; shahmaras, G.K. sheh-
mdras, to the python.

A final short a is sometimes dropped, as in gar, gar?, and



INTRODUCTION lxv

gara, G.K. gara, a house ; doh, doha, etc., G.K. ddha, on a day ;
8ar, sar?, save, and sera, G.K. sam, investigation.

In standard Kashmiri a borrowed word ending in a con-
sonant preceded by a long a often adds a final short a. Thus
jahaz, a ship, becomes jahdza ; nishdn, a sign, becomes
nishdna, and so on. Sir Aurel Stein gives three words of this
kind to which G.K. does not add a final a. These are chdldna,
G.K. cdldn, an invoice ; Idl and Idl?, G.K. Idl, a ruby ; mal?,
G.K. mai, property. We have also a added in dopusa, G.K.
dopus, said to him, and chuka, G.K. chukh, thou art.

In the standard dialect, when a is followed by u-matra it
becomes il. Sir Aurel Stein usually represents this sound by
a. A good example is the feminine genitive postposition
which G.K. writes silnz u , and which Sir Aurel usually writes
sanz. Occasionally he represents it by u. Thus we have also
sunz ; dsus, G.K. os u s, she was to him. For G.K.'s thud u or
thilr u , on the back, we have tad, tor, tar, and tilr. The
syllable u y is represented by uy, ily, and ai. Thus G.K.'s
tamis il y, to him verily, becomes tarn 1 suy or tarn 1 sily, while
timan u y, to them verily, becomes tim?nai. Another example
of the representation of ii by u is G.K.'s wutsh u , she descended,
which becomes vuts (iii, 2), and the same word also represents
G.K.'s wdtsh u , she went up (iii, 1, 3).

The letter a or dh, when final and representing the indefinite
article, is usually shortened to a or a, as in doha, G.K. dohd,
a day ; dalila and dalila, G.K. dalildh, a story ; zdla and zdld,
G.K. zdldh, a net. Similarly, although there is no suffix of
the indefinite article, shora ga and shoragd, G.K. shora-gdh,
an outcry. Often, however, as, for instance, in some of the
above examples, the long d is retained.

When d is followed in G.K.'s dialect by u-matra, by i-matra,
or by i it becomes 6, and this same 6 also usually represents
the pronunciation of the diphthong ai. Sir Aurel Stein some-
times represents this 6 by a, which according to his phonetic
system represents approximately the same sound. Thus â€”

zolith, having burnt, zdlit,

and others. For original ai we have â€”

gov, different, gar, g&ri,

Jchordth, alms, khdrdt,

solas, for an excursion, sdlas,

and others.

The word myon u , mine (fern.), appears in various forms,
viz. meny, mye, m y en, myen, and m v eny, in all of which the
6 is represented by e; whereas for the corresponding cybn u ,
thy (fern.), we have ch^dn, clV^an 1 , and ch v an v .

We have seen that G.K. usually represents u by 6, as in
hod 1 for kud*, sbty for silty. Sir Aurel Stein writes for these
words k&d, ka^d*, and hud 1 , and sait, saP, etc., respectively.

When a is followed in G.K.'s dialect by u-matra it becomes
6, and Sir Aurel Stein almost always gives for it his sign a,
which represents the same sound. Thus â€”

G.K. Hatim.

okhun, a teacher, dkhun, dJchun,

6l u , a nest, at,

6s u , he was, as, ds u , as, os,

6y, he came to thee, ay, ay,

bdwun, he explained, bdvun,

and many others. It will be seen from the above that a, a,
and o are also used to represent this sound. So, for khotuni,
to the lady, we have khdtuni and khditini ; for Idyun, he
struck, Idyun and Idyun ; for soruy, all, sdruy, saruy, soWi,
and soira ; for bow u , manifested, bou. There are many other
similar examples, and from the above it will be seen that G.K.'s
o and 6 are represented indiscriminately by a, a, and a.

The vowel e is, we have seen, interchangeable with a. It is
also liable to be shortened to e-matra when final, as in bdye,
bay 6 , or even bai, for G.K.'s bdye, to a wife.

We have already noticed that in Kashmiri a after sh
becomes e (i.e. Sir Aurel Stein's e). In one instance Hatim



lxviii KASHMIBI STOBIES AND SONGS

has o for this e, G.K.'s shekh, hesitation, being represented by
shah or shok.

It is well known that the average Kashmiri is unable to
distinguish between the letters e and i, whether long or
short. In this way Hatim gives e instead of G.K.'s I in the

followingâ€”

G.K. Hatim.

bUh\ seated (m. pi.), bmh\ beth?, and bat\

gristf-bay, a farmer's wife, grist bay,
phirith, having returned, pherith, pherith, or phirit,
and others. It will be observed that, in the case of bat 1 , I has
become a. Similarly, G.K.'s rinz*, balls, is represented by
rinz, renz, or ranz ; and his tresh, thirst, by tresh or tras.
Owing to the confusion of a and e and of i and e (Stein's e),
we sometimes have a for i. Thus G.K.'s gristf-baye, to a
farmer's wife, becomes grist? baye, gresta baye, or grest baye.
Similarly, G.K.'s ddp^ziheJch, thou must say to them, is repre-
sented by dabzi hek or dabza hek ; G.K.'s wds { zi, you should
descend, by vaz l za ; and yith, to this, by yet, yath, yat, and yat.
As regards u, we occasionally observe hesitation as to
quantity. Thus G.K.'s dop u nas, he said to him, is represented
by both dop u nas and dopunas ; and his yuswph, Joseph, by
yusuf, yusuf, and yusuf.

Just as in the case of e and i, so ordinary Kashmiris are
unable to distinguish between o and u. There are numerous
examples of this in Hatim's language. A few will suffice here â€”
G.K. Hatim.

borun, he filled, borun and burun,

Jcodun, he brought out, Icodun, kudun,

kut a walan, by the policeman, hotvalan, kutvalen,
not u , a pitcher, nut,

byuth u , he sat, bydth, byuth,

purun, he put on, porun, purun.

The Persian khubsurat, beautiful, becomes khobsurath in
G.K., for which Hatim has Ichob surat and hhab surat.

Once or twice we find u interchanged with other vowels.
Thus we have che for chuh, he is ; and (once each) chiy or chi v



INTRODUCTION lxix

for chuy, he is verily. The imperative tshun, cast thou, is
represented by tsiln, but elsewhere the u of this word is
preserved. After y, u or o has a tendency to become ii, as in
d v utuk, dyutuk, d y utuk, or d y ilthuk, for dyutukh, they gave ;
h y utun or hyiitun, for kyotun, he began.

An initial u in Kashmiri is always pronounced wu. This
is not usually the case with an initial 6, but G.K.'s ora,
thence, is represented not only by dra and similar forms, but
also by voda.

It is well known that e and e are usually pronounced in
Kashmiri with a short y before them. Thus y e, y e. This y is
not usually written in G.K.'s transcription, but it is everywhere
to be presumed. Sir Aurel Stein as a rule writes this y either
as a small letter above the line or as a full y. Examples will
be found on every page of his text. A few are given here â€”

O.K. Stein.

khekh, thou wilt eat, kyek,

khewdn, eating, khyavdn, khyevdn, k y avdn,

keth, in, kh y ath, khyath, k y et, kyet,

petha, from, peta, pyete, p y eth, p y etha.

It will be observed that ya is sometimes used instead of e.
Other similar cases are â€”

ketha, how ? kyataj&etaj&etaj&itajclivatha

khoni, on the haunch, kun y a }

neza, railings, n y dza,

zeni, he will conquer, za if ni, z y dni.

Turning to consonants, we first draw attention to the
well-known fact that, as in all Dardic languages, Kashmiri
possesses no sonant aspirates. Original sonant aspirates are
always disaspirated. This is fully borne out by Hatim's
pronunciation. There is only one occurrence of an aspirated
sonant consonant in the whole of Sir Aurel Stein's transcription.
This is in the word ghdsh (viii, 9), for gwdsh or gash, light,
which Sir Aurel writes elsewhere as gash (five times).

But Hatim's pronunciation goes further. The aspiration of
surd consonants is most irregular, many such sounds that are



lxx KASHMIBI S TOBIES AND SONGS

written by G.K. and elsewhere as aspirated surds are dis-
aspirated, and many unaspirated surds are aspirated. In some
cases this runs uniformly through every occurrence of a word
or letter. Thus the verb gatshun, to go, is always written
gatsun, and the letter c is almost invariably written ch. In
other cases the aspiration or disaspiration is more capricious.

In the Kashmiri of Isvara Kaula and other Hindus a final
surd is always, with a few specified exceptions, aspirated, while
Musalmans retain the unaspirated sound. Thus we have â€”

Musalman. Hindu.

krak, outcry, krakh.

thap, seizing, thaph.

rat, blood, rath,

not, palsy, nath.

kats, glass, katsh.

The transcript of these tales by Govinda Kaula follows the
Hindu custom and aspirates final surds. With Hatim it is,
curiously enough, almost a question of date. The recording
of Sir Aurel Stein's transcription commenced on June 16, and
continued, with intervals, till July 31, 1896. In the earlier
parts of this transcription final surds were not aspirated, but
in recording the recitation of July 24, Sir Aurel wrote the
word thaph (xii, 11), seizing, previously recorded as thap or
tap, and makes a special note on the margin that in this
instance the ph is a true aspirate. An examination of the rest
of the text recorded on that day and on the following and
final recitation of July 31, shows that the final surds are here
much more consistently aspirated than had been the case
previously. It is out of the question to assume that the non-
recording of this aspiration in the earlier tales was due to
faulty audition on the part of Sir Aurel Stein. He was,
I know, perfectly aware at the time of this distinction between
Musalman and Hindu pronunciation, and had previously corre-
sponded with me on the subject.

The following are examples of Hatim's disaspiration : â€”
For the letter b we may take the Arabic borrowed word
8ub a han, at dawn, for which H. has suban ; but how



INTRODUCTION lxxi

inconsistent he is in this is shown by the following cognate
forms : subu for subuh ; subahanas for sub a hanas ; and subhas
for sub a has.

We have said that the letter c is almost always aspirated
to ch. Similarly, the aspiration of ch (very common in the
auxiliary verb chuh, he is) is generally retained. But, in one
instance (i, 13), city is written for chuy, he is indeed. Another
similar case is that of the verb wuchun, to see. In this the
ch is usually retained ; but we have vucehan (ii, 5) for
wuchahan, vucuk (ii, 4) for tvuchukh, and vucun (ii, 8) for
wuchun.

Of more frequent occurrence is the aspirate kh, and of this
disaspiration is frequent. Thus â€”

Initial. â€” While the borrowed Persian word khub, well,
always preserves its aspiration, khdb, a dream, becomes kab
and kdv ; khabar, news, is spelt kabar, etc., in the first five
stories, and khabar, etc., afterw r ards ; and Khbdd, God, becomes
Kudd, etc., in i-vi, and Khudd, etc., afterwards. Similarly â€”

khalat-e-shdhi, a royal robe, becomes kalHi shdhi.

khdm, unripe, â€ž khdm and kdm.

khumdr, languishment, â€ž kumdr.

khan, N.P., â€ž khan (ii,l) and kdn(ii, 12).

khoni, on the haunch, â€ž kun y a.

khar, an ass, â€ž khar (iii) and kar (v).

khoran, to the feet, â€ž kuran.

khash, a cut, â€ž kash.

The verb khasun, to ascend, retains the aspirate, except in
forms derived from the past participle khot u , in which the
aspiration sometimes persists and is sometimes lost, giving
forms such as khot u , khut, and kut ; khat 1 and kaHy ; katis ;
khats and kats.

khota, than, becomes khota, khuta, and kuta.

khotHna, a lady, â€ž kotuna (v) and khdtun (x, xii).

khatith, secretly, â€ž kaHith.

khdwand, a husband, â€ž kdvand (i-viii) and khdvand (x-xii).



Ixxii KASHMIRI STORIES AND SONGS

The verb khyon u , to eat, as a rule has 7c in the earlier tales
and lch in the later, but this is not universal. Thus we have
Jchyau for khev, eaten, in ii, 2. Occasionally also the cognate
Shina language disaspirates in this word.

Khazmath or Icliizmatli, service, becomes Ichismat (ii, 3) and
kismat (xii, 3), and so many others.

It will be observed that the disaspiration occurs 'whether
the lch represents the Indian aspirate or whether it represents
a Persian ~.. It will also be noticed that, generally speaking,
but not universally, when there are two forms, one with and
the other without the aspiration, the disaspirated forms occur
in the earlier stories and the aspirated forms in the later
stories. The same is true for the other instances of disaspira-
tion, and I shall not trouble to refer to it again. It will,
however, be understood that numerous, though not so numerous,
instances of disaspiration occur also in the later stories.

Medial lch is not so common, but we can quote palca for
palcha, wings ; tdkhit (x, 12) and taJcit (xi, 13) for tdhkhith,
certainly ; vutamalc 1 for wotamukh i , upside down.

Final lch occurs in akh, one, which is represented both by ah
and akh in all parts of the tales, though alch occurs only in i, 4,
and four times in xii. For phakh, a stink, we have only phak.
Initial ph is preserved in the phak just quoted. For phamb,
cotton wool, we have phamb and pamb, both in viii. For
phardd, on the morrow, we have parda ; while the verb
pherun, to regret, loses its aspiration twice and preserves it
once in viii.

Medial ph occurs in naphtsas, for the belly, which H. pro-
nounced naptsas (x, 3).

Final ph occurs in the word thaph, grasping. It appears
under the forms thaph, thap, and tap.

Although not strictly an aspirate, we may here quote the
shh in the borrowed Arabic word mashhur, celebrated, which
H. (xi, 3) pronounced maushur:

Initial th occurs in the following : in thud (thod u ), erect, it is
preserved. For thur iL , a shrub, we have tier, and for thur u or
thud u , on the back, we have tad, tar, and tor ; thiln^a, butter,



INTBODUCTION lxxiii

preserves the th ; but for thaph, grasping, we have thaph,
thap, and tap. The common verb tltdwun, to place, generally
preserves the th, but we have thdvum and tdvum, and, for
thavHaw, taivtau.

Medial th occurs in the following : atha, a hand, becomes
both atha, etc., and ata, etc., the aspirated forms occurring
most frequently in the later tales ; buth u , a face, is always
but ; so, for ath u r il , the woodworm, atar ; for hatha, stories,
hatha, etc., and kata ; neth a r, a wedding, neth/Jr (xii) and
n v etar (viii) ; pathar, downward, pathar and patar, etc. ; woth u ,
descended, vut and vuth, and similarly in derived forms ; and
similarly woth u , ascended, also becomes vut or vuth. Other
examples are vatqtrith for watharith, having spread out, but
this verb fluctuates as regards the aspirate in other forms ;
wothus, arose to him, becomes vothus, etc., or votus ; and
wdthith, having arisen, vuthit and vutit. Sdthdh, a moment,
becomes sdtha or sdta.

For final th the pronoun ath generally becomes at, except
that we have both at and ath in xii. Conjunctive participles,
such as wdthith just cited, almost always end in t, the th-
termination being frequent only in xii ; the postposition keth,
in, becomes k v et, etc., except in xii, where we have kh v ath, etc.,
with exceptional aspiration of the k. The distributive particle
prath always becomes prat. Pronominal datives, such as tath,
kath, etc., follow ath in sometimes dropping the aspiration and
sometimes (in the later stories) keeping it.

For initial th the only real example is thahardn, awaiting,
for which H. has tah?rdn.

There are more examples of medial th, such as bontha, in
front, which always has the dental t, as in bont?, etc. ; byuth u ,
seated, and its derivatives also generally disaspirate the th,
except in xii, which also retains the aspiration. Kuth u ,& room,
also disaspirates except once in x, 7, where we have the dative
kuthis, while in x, 8 we have kutis and kutis ; the ablative
postposition petha occurs in several forms, peta, pyete, p v etha,
p v eth, and p v etha, the aspirated forms occurring chiefly in the
later stories. Similar is the treatment of poth 1 or pothin, like,

/



lxxiv KASHMIRI STORIES AND SONGS

for which we have paH 1 , etc., and pqHht, etc., and patin and
pdthin. The common word sethdh, very, much, appears as
seta, etc., and setha, etc., it being noted that both forms occur
in xii ; toth u or thoth u , beloved, is always tot, and zith 1 , long
(m.pl.), becomes zU\

Initial tsh is always disaspirated by H. Thus the word
bhunun, to throw, is always bunun, and so for all others.

As for medial tsh, in the verb gabhnn, to go, to be proper,
it is always disaspirated by H. The same applies to the
indefinite pronoun kenbhdh, something, which appears under
many forms, in none of which does an aspirated tsh appear.
Similarly, we have matsa and mats v e for matshi, on the
shoulder; rabeh^na for rabhi-hand, a little; vub for wobh il ,
she went up, and also for wubh u , she went down, and others.

Turning now to aspiration, we may commence with the
general statement that every c is aspirated by H. The solitary
exception is the word ceshma, an eye (i, 3), w T hich appears as
ceshma. Thus we have â€”

G.K. H.

cenda, a pocket, chanda.

cith 1 , a letter, chit,

bace, young ones, bache.

bacdwiin 12 , to be released (fern.), bachdviny.

7iayistdnihc ii , of the canebrake, nayis tan nach.

racen, she took them (fern.), rachen.

zace, rags, zache.

Reference has already been made to the aspiration of g in*

Examples of the aspiration of k are : â€”

kur u , a daughter, kud, khud.

kombakas, for help, khumba khas.

ketha, how ? l&eta, kh v atha.

kenbhdh, something, kye ba, etc., or khye ba.

kdsun, to shave (xii), khdsun.
kot u , a son (xii), khuth.



INTRODUCTION lxxv

For the aspiration of p, we have put, puth, phot, or phut, for
pot u , back again. Shina has phot for this word.

For the aspiration of initial t, we have tal or thai, for tal
below ; tot, tut, or tltuth y for tot u , thither ; and than for tdv,
exhaustion.

Medial t is also sometimes aspirated. The termination ta of
the polite imperative often becomes thq, etc., as in karta or kar
the, for karta, please to do ; tsuntha for tshunta, please to throw.
So also the termination mot u of the perfect participle becomes
muth in on muth, for on u mot u , brought ; vot u mut or vot u muth,
for wdt u mot u , arrived. The t in dyut u , given, is aspirated in
dyut or dyuth, for dyut u ; d v iltuk or d v ilthuk, for dyutukh,
they gave ; dithin, for ditin, he gave them. Similarly â€”
G.K. Hatim.

kyut u , for, kh v ut, k v ut, kyut, khyuth, kyuth.

foÂ£ w , thither, foÂ£, Â£uÂ£, thuth.

wot u , arrived, vot, etc., or voth.

The above is in no way a complete list of all the instances of
disaspiration and aspiration. It is merely a selection of typical
examples.

The Dardic languages as a rule have no cerebral letters.
Literary Kashmiri, however, preserves the distinction between
cerebral and dental almost as carefully as is the case in India.
There are, nevertheless, a few striking examples to the contrary,
as in dutakh or dutakh, cutting in two ; dot or dal, a leaf ; and
wothun, to arise, as compared with the Hindi uthnd. But even
in the literary language the pronunciation of cerebral letters
cannot be so definitely cerebral as in India, for in Kashmiri
poetry cerebral consonants are permitted to rhyme with
dentals, a thing which is impossible in Indian verse. Thus,
in the Rdmdvatdracarita, the proper name Yindrazith,
Indrajita, rhymes with dith il , seen, in verse 699, and with
bith u , seated, in verse 872.



lxxvi KASHMIRI STORIES AND SONGS

In the village Kashmiri of Hatim, the state of affairs is
altogether different. Here the utmost confusion exists, dentals
being used for cerebrals, and cerebrals for dentals, almost
at random. From the numerous examples that follow it is
evident that Hatim used an intermediate sound that at one
time struck Sir Aurel Stein's ears as cerebral and at another
as dental. If Hatim had pronounced real cerebral sounds, it
is impossible to suppose that Sir Aurel, with his long
familiarity with Indian languages, could have failed to notice
them, more especially as some of the words written with dental
letters, such as dak, a stage, are words that are in everyday
use in India both in colloquial speech and in literature. It
might be thought that here and there Sir Aurel may have
omitted a subscript dot by a slip of the pen ; but the omissions
are too frequent and too regular to permit this assumption to
be taken as a general explanation, and, moreover, it will not
account for those cases in which he has marked as cerebrals,
letters which in the corresponding Hindi or Sanskrit are
always dental. The following are examples of this confusion.
The list is in no way complete : â€”

In Kashmiri the letter r is a dental letter, not a cerebral

interchange with a dental I, as in Hatim's mol or mor, for
literary mol u , father. The same is the case in the North-
Western languages, Sindhl and Lahnda. The village con-
fusion between cerebrals and dentals hence explains the

While Dardic languages show a general tendency to harden
sonant consonants, Hatim shows occasional instances of the
softening of surds. In every case except one the softened
consonant is immediately followed by z. In the one exception,
it is s that is softened to z. The examples are â€”



G.K.

ddphihekh, thou shouldst have

them,
but ddp^hiiythou shouldst say to me,

wds i zi, thou shouldst descend,
but was i zi-na, thou shouldst not
descend,
pes, they fell on him,
On the other hand, Hatim gives occasional instances of the
Dardic hardening of sonants. Such are â€”

G.K. Hatim.

tab, fever, tap.

rasad, assembly, rasat.

mov lag, do not fix, maidalc.

khazmath, service, Jcismat.

khizmath, service, khismat.

In this connexion we may again refer to G.K.'s pdtashdh
H.'s pddshah, a king.

Turning to individual consonants, we note â€”

(1) We have prothesis of h before y in â€”

G.K. Hatim.

yun u , to come, 2/#Â», h y iln.

yuthuy, as verily, yilthuy, h v ilthuy.

(2) kh becomes h in â€”

shekhtsd, a certain person, shahisa.



lxxxii KASHMIBI STORIES AND SONGS

Possibly shahtsa is a slip of the pen, for elsewhere Hatim has
shakhtsan, shakhtsas, and so on.,

(3) The affricative ts sometimes becomes s, as in â€”

G.K. Hatim.

tsoce, loaves, suche, su cho, buche.

(sopor*, in four directions, so pa { ri, tso patr*.

It becomes z in â€”

pants, five, points, panz.

The representation of G.K.'s adalilts^-peth, in court, by
addlat-p v eth, is probably a slip of the pen.

With these changes of ts we may compare the interchange of
ch and sh in Hatim's mach-tular, a bee, with the mash-tulari of
the title of Story IX. Similarly, we have zh for j in zhama for
jama, a coat.

(4) ny and ny are interchangeable, as in Hatim's kanye-
phul and kailye phul, a pebble. This is hardly more than
a variation of spelling.

(5) Hatim usually preserves a Persian /, while G.K. has ph
instead. Thus, Hatim fakir, G.K. phaklr, a mendicant. For
" thought " Hatim has both fikftr and phikir.

(6) The letter sh is sometimes represented by s. Sir Aurel
Stein's MS. represents the sound of sh by s, and the occasional
apparent change of sh to s is probably due to the accidental
omission of the subscript dot. An example is the word
shemsher, a sword, for which we have sJtamsher, shamser, and
samsher.

(7) Vocalization of the semi-vowels y and v is frequent, as
in gai for gay, they went ; gau or gaxi for gav, he went ;
m&ryw for mariwa, (he who) may kill ; tsalau for tsaliv, flee
ye ; dimau for dimav, we shall give ; and many others.

(8) An example of metathesis is tsorasta for tsoratsh, a
leather-cutter.

(9) H. uses initial v for b in Vikarmajit- for G.K.'s
Bikarmdjit-, Vikramaditya. Cf. kab or kav, for khab, a
dream.



INTRODUCTION lxxxiii

(10) Three miscellaneous words are â€”

G.K. Hatim.

bakh a cbyish, a present, bakcayish, bakhsltayish.

jalwa, glory, jafcva.

but jelby, even glory, yala vai.

sakHh, hard, sale, sakh.

The processes of declension and conjugation employed by
Hatim are on the whole the same as those employed by
Govinda Kaula. The principal differences relate to the
pronunciation of the forms, and to the representation of that
pronunciation by Sir Aurel Stein's transcription. A few
additional points may here be noticed.

In the declension of nouns, Govinda Kaula, like Isvara
Kaula, makes the dative singular of nouns of the first declension
end in as, as in bagas, to a garden. Hatim sometimes has the
termination as, and sometimes as. Examples of both will be
found on almost every page. As a specimen, it will suffice to
quote the two forms bagas and bagas both occurring close
together in ii, 1. Similarly, in the genitive of the same
declension, H. has sunasand 1 (v. 3) and sanasand 1 (v. 4), both
for G.K.'s sona-sdnd 1 , of gold (m. pi.). In these genitives,
also, H. sometimes drops the final a of the stem, as in sunar
sanz, for G.K.'s sonara-silnz 11 , of the goldsmith (fern, sing.)
(v. 1); iJddshah sund, for G.K.'s patashaha-sond u , of the king
(vi. 11). There is a curious example of a feminine noun
declined as if it were masculine in Jcudis-saHh (possibly a slip
for kudi saHh), for G.K.'s kore-suty, with the girl (v. 10) ; and
in xii, 15, we have the masculine form kuhiiy, used instead of
the feminine kuh u y, only one. Instances like rlnz, rqnz, and
renz, for rlnz 1 , balls ; soira, so^i, saruy, and sdruy for soruy,
all ; za, ze, and z y i, for z a h, two, belong rather to phonetics than
to declension.

Similarly, the variations in pronominal forms are really
matters of spelling or pronunciation. Boh, I, is represented by
bo, bu ; for rayon 1 , my (m. pi. masc), we have men v , mye, and
m v en, and for the fern. sing. mybn il we have meny, mye, m v en,
myen, and m v efiy. For ts a h, thou, we have su, tsa, tsa, tsi, and



lxxxiv KASHMIRI STORIES AND SONGS

isu, and for cyon u , thy, chun, ch y un, chon, chon y , chony, and
ch v on, all with the aspirated ch.

The proximate demonstrative pronoun yih, this, and the
relative yih, what, appear under the forms yi and yu, and
the emphatic forms yihuy, etc., appear under quite a number of
variant spellings. The relative m. sg. nom. yus appears as yis,
yus, and yds, and its fem. yesa as yesa (x, 1) and yasi (x, 6).
In viii, 1, for yihunzâ„¢, of these (fem. sg. nom.), we have yihas.
As for the remote demonstrative pronoun, its emphatic fem.
sg. nom. say or soy, she verily, appears as sai, sai, say, and say.
The indefinite pronoun Jceh, with its various case-forms, appears
under a great variety of spellings. The principal of these have
been dealt with under the head of phonetics.

The representation of the various forms of the verb
substantive is very irregular. A few examples will suffice.

For chuh, he is, we have che (v. 4) ; for chuy, he is verily,
chi, chi, chi v , chiy, and cuy (sic) ; for chivd, is he ?, cha ; for
cheh, she is, cha, che, chu ; for chey, she is to thee, che and
chay ; for chiwa, ye are, chu ; for chiway, if ye are, chu vol
and chu vai ; and for chili, they are, che, chi, chu, and ch v a.

As regards the conjugation of the active verb, there are

numerous departures from G.K.'s spelling, nearly all of which

fall under the head of phonetics. Here we may mention the

following, which really appear to indicate difference of form : â€”

O.K. Habim.

sholan, burning, sholan. This form of

the present participle
is old, and nowadays
appears only in poetry
and dialects.
yilch-na, wilt thou not come, yihna.
dis, give to her, disa.

hadon, we shall pass over it, karon v .



INTRODUCTION lxxxv

III

ON THE METRES OF HATIM'S SONGS

By SIR AUREL STEIN

On my return to Kashmir at the close of 1917 Sir George
Grierson asked me to inquire into the system of metrification
followed in certain old Kashmiri poems of the Bhakti type in
which he is interested. I have tried to comply with his
request as far as it lay in me, i.e. in full consciousness of the
fact that my philological training had never comprised any
special study of metrics. After examining portions from
a number of these compositions as recited by professional
cyat-gar 1 , I arrived at the conclusion that the metre of these
poems is based solely on the number of stress accent syllables
counted in each line or pdda. No regard is paid to quantity,
even where the structure of the verses is apparently modelled
on the pattern of Hindi metres dependent on quantity.
Pandit Nityananda Sastrl, of the SrI-Pratap College, Srinagar,
a very competent Kashmiri scholar, to whom I submitted this
view, has endorsed it.

In order to test this conclusion with reference to the metres
of Hatim's songs I secured a visit of the old storyteller, now in
his 62nd year, in June, 1918, when my summer camp was once
more pitched on Mohand Marg. I had him recite again the
metrified story of Sultam Mahmud Ghaznavl, the one which of
those heard from his lips in 1896 I had best in my recollection.
He also gave me the benefit of several songs of lyrical contents
(ghazal), some of his own composition, which used to be
favourite numbers in his repertoire, showing more elaborate
versification.

In recording these with special regard to their metre
I convinced myself that their verses, whether simple couplets,
as in the case of the metrified story just referred to, or built up
in more intricate stanzas, have for their constructive principle
solely the number of syllables bearing the stress accent of the
present colloquial speech. The system is based mainly on
the counting of the primary stress accent of each word, but



lxxxvi KASHMIRI STORIES AND SONGS

permits also the counting of secondary stress accents for the
sake of metrical convenience. This latitude, which reference
to the last words in verses 1, 11, 12, 13 of Mahmud Ghaznavi's
story may help to illustrate, has its parallel in the rudeness of
the rhyme. In this, as verses 3 and 8 show, the vowel sounds
of the closing syllables need not agree, as long as the final
consonant is the same.

The general rule is that throughout a song the lines, usually
rhymed, composing a couplet or stanza, should have a certain
fixed number of stress-accented syllables, in conformity with
the scheme determining the length of each line. But this
simple rule is on occasion ignored through " poetical license ",
i.e. whenever the rustic poet's skill would be taxed too severely
by strict adherence to his metrical scheme. The second line of
verse 4 in Mahmud Ghaznavi's story with its seven accented
syllables instead of the regular six is an illustration.

The lilt of the musical air which, as in the case of Indian
poetical compositions generally, is an essential concomitant of
the recital, helps, no doubt, to smooth over such irregularities
for the not very fastidious ears of the village audience.
I regret that my total want of musical knowledge has
precluded my ever noting down any of these popular Kashmir
airs, often far more attractive to the untrained European ear
than the melodies of India proper.

In order to illustrate Hatim's metrical system, the stress-
accents in the Mahmud Ghaznavl story have been indicated by
appropriate marks.

I. MAIIMUD OF GHAZNl AND THE FISHERMAN

Sultan Mahmiid of Ghaznl, the king of kings, used himself to
watch over the protection of his kingdom.

Disguised as a Faqlr, he used to wander from bazaar to bazaar,
to see if any of his subjects were in distress.

In one place were the people making prayers for his welfare,
and their eyes were satisfied by his justice.

In another place, he saw a wretched fisherman, brought low by
poverty.

5. In his poverty he was uttering sighs and groans. In his
poverty even his sense had deserted him.

Even where he skilfully cast his net, even there naught came
into it.

Said the King to him, " Make me thy partner, and fling one more
cast of the net, keeping firm within thy heart the memory of God."
â€¢ So he flung one more cast and, behold, within his net he caught
a hundred fish, and brought them all before the King.

In exchange for the hundred fish the King gave him wealth of
money, rubies and jewels, possessions and pearls in camel-loads. 1

10. After he had passed the night, the King called for him and
said, " Verily thou becamest my partner without hope or expecta-
tion of result (and yet thou hast thereby acquired great wealth).

" It is the power of Providence alone that removeth poverty, (and
giveth) sunshine and shade, heat and cold, and the new spring.

" Verily I would say to thee, ' Know this, slave â€” accept thou
(these as coming from the Almighty), for by how much power
wouldst thou thyself have been able to remove thy poverty ? ' "

Concerning this hath a certain teacher uttered this prayer,
" The hope of this slave, Ahmad, is (on Him from whom pro-
ceedeth) all the universe."

1 The King rewarded him because instead of bringing him the worst fifty
fish, he brought the whole hundred from which the King might choose his
share. As a reward the King bought also the fisherman's share of the hundred
for a very high price.

II. THE TALE OF A PARROT

1. This is what my Master told me : â€”

There was a certain country, the land of Persia, and it was
ruled by a king named Bahadur Khan. He had made a garden for
his womenfolk, into which no stranger was allowed to enter ; but
once there came into it a Faqir. The discerners then discerned
him, and the newsmen gave the news to the King. Said they,
" A Faqir has come into the garden." The King heard, and took
with him his Vizier. To the garden they went, and there he
saw the Faqir.

2. The Almighty, who hath a hundred thousand names, watch eth

over every path.
Hark ye, loyalty is monstrous rare. 1
" Faqir, how didst thou enter ?

Where dost thou belong ? whence art thou come ? "

Quoth the Faqir : â€”

I came but for a stroll. What of yours have I eaten ? "
Hark ye, loyalty is monstrous rare.

3. It chanced that before the King there was a flowering plant,
and at its foot a dead nightingale. As soon as they spoke angrily
to the Faqir, he fell flat, lifeless to the ground, and as he did so
the nightingale arose alive. Such magic power did he show the
King. The nightingale flew out of the garden, and returned.
Then it fell dead and the Faqir again became alive. He began to
depart, but they entreated him, saying : â€”

" Faqir, let me be thy servant !

Cups of the cream of milk will I fill for thee.
Special pilaos and dainties wilt thou not eat '? "
Hark ye, loyalty is monstrous rare.

4. So the Faqir confided the secret of his magic power to the
King, and the King confided it to his Vizier.

1 Literally a phoenix, a vara avis, the Arabic 'anqd. In the original, the
imperative "hark ye" is in the singular; I have put it into the plural, as
more consonant with English idiom.

The King gave instructions to the Vizier,
And he thus became proficient in the secret.

They went out hunting together.
Hark ye, loyalty is monstrous rare.

In the forest they saw a parrot lying dead.
" Vizier, how beautiful this must have been.
Put thou, I beseech thee, thy life into it for but a moment."
Hark ye, loyalty is monstrous rare.

Said the Vizier :â€”
" My King, for long hath it been dead.

A stink cometh from it ; who knoweth when it died ?
Stay here I cannot ; Sir, what am I to do ? "
* Hark ye, loyalty is monstrous rare.

5. For this did the King make urgent entreaty to the "Vizier.
" Fain would I see how beautiful the parrot was," but the Vizier
refused to listen to him.

And, further, my Master told me : â€”

Tn his heart there was treachery. At length the King himself
abandoned his own body and entered into the parrot. Up rose
the parrot, and flew about. Then the Vizier did a deed : he
himself entered into the King's body. That was what had all
along been in his heart.

The burden which had been the King's to bear,
That became laid upon the foolish Vizier.

Treachery was watching in him like a petitioner.
Hark ye, loyalty is monstrous rare.

6. The parrot is flying in the air, and the Vizier is in the body
of the King. He stood up.

He mounted the (King's) horse and went irto the army.

He said to them : â€”

" The Vizier fell from his horse and is dead."
That was the news that the newsman brought.
Hark ye, loyalty is monstrous rare.

-10] XL THE TALE OF A P ABBOT 9

7. When this Vizier had done the deed, and when he had
entered into the King's body, in his hand he raised his sword, and
into small pieces did he cut his own dead body. Then said he to his
army, " Go forth, ye archers, and ye gunmen. Whoever of you
killeth a parrot, to him will be given a reward." When the parrot
heard this order he fled afar, and went to the Faqir, who on that
day had been in the garden.

He gave the order to the archers,
" Pay ye heed, I pray, to my coaxing."
He gave an order that the parrot should be killed.
Hark ye, loyalty is monstrous rare.

8. Now, as for the real king, he was in the parrot, and had taken
refuge with the Faqir ; so that parrot was not killed by anyone.
One day the Vizier-King sallied forth to hunt ; and when he had
reached a certain place he descried a hind. After it they made
pursuit. They brought it into the army, and he said to them,
" T will cut oft the head of him who letteth her escape."

9. And, further, my Master told me : â€”

But the hind gave a sudden spring and leaped over the head of
the Vizier-King himself. They pursued her. Now the parrot-
King was with the Faqir, 1 and that Faqir was a magician clairvoyant.
Quoth he to the parrot-King, " Go forth, your Majesty, to-day
wilt thou regain thine own body." Meanwhile the hind had far
outdistanced her pursuers.

10. Furthermore, my Master told me : â€”

There there lay a dead bear. The Vizier-King entered into the
bear and pursued the hind, leaving the real King's body lying on
the ground.

The news of the Vizier-King's coming was heard by the parrot.
Thither did he run.
He waited, watching from a tree-hole.
He again entered into his own body ; wish ye him all good
luck !
Hark ye, loyalty is monstrous rare.

11. Down fell the parrot dead, and the King entered his own
body, but he who had been the Vizier was now in the bear. The
real King mounted his horse, and said to his men, " Shoot ye that
bear." They fired with their guns at him, and brake his leg.
They seized him and brought him before the King. Said the King,
" Treachery was done by thee to me. What can I do but kill thee ?
Otherwise people will say of me, ' He hath a bear for a Vizier/
Thou hast destroyed thine own body. Now no longer can I keep
a bear like thee as a Vizier. Sir, I am about to kill thee."

12. And my Master further said : â€”

They brought firewood, and they burnt the Vizier to ashes.
A hundred years passed, less or more.

And then came the messenger of Death to Bahadur Khan.
Wahb, the blacksmith, 1 cry " Allah, Allah ! "
Hark ye, loyalty is monstrous rare.

III. THE TALE OF A MERCHANT

1. A Merchant once went forth to trade, leaving his wife at home,
and she for long became filled with love for a beggarman â€” a Faqlr.
One day the Merchant came home with the chattels he had bought,
and to the King came the news that " the Merchant hath returned ".
At night the King went forth to wander through the city, and he
reached the Merchant's house. While he was standing there, at
the end of the first watch of the night, the Merchant's wife got
up and went forth carrying a dish of cooked rice upon her head.
The King watched her in secret. On ahead went she, and along
after her followed the King. They arrived at a certain open space
where the beggarman was seated over a little fire. She made
salutation to him, and laid the dish of rice before him. Quoth she :
" Eat ! " But straightway he raised a cudgel and with it struck
the Merchant's wife. He said unto her, " Why hast thou come so
late ? " She made reply to him, " My husband came home to-day,
and hence was I delayed. Eat now, prithee, this dish of rice."
But the beggarman said to her, " I will not eat. First bring me that
Merchant's head. Then, and not till then, will 1 sup." Now all
this time the King was watching, and he heard all this talk that
passed between them.

2. Furthermore, my Master told me : â€”

The Merchant's wife went off, and came to her own home.
She went upstairs, while the King stayed down below. She cut
off her husband's head, and came down with it wrapped in a
handkerchief. On ahead went she, and along after her went the
King. She came to the beggarman. He raised his stick and struck
the Merchant's wife. Said he to her, " Thou wast not true to thine
own husband. Now wilt thou be true to me ? "

3. The King departed. He returned to his palace and went to
his bed. Morning blossomed forth, and there was raised a cry.
They say : " The Merchant came home and thieves have killed
him." To the palace came the Merchant's wife. She saith unto the
King, " My husband came home to me, and he hath been killed by
thieves." The King knoweth well who killed the Merchant, while

the people are seeking for a clue to find the murderers. But on no
one can they fix the guilt.

4. And, further, my Master said : â€”

They brought out the Merchant's body and burnt it. The
King went forth to the place of cremation and watched everything
that should come to pass. There came up the widow, on her way
to burn herself upon her husband's pyre. She was saying : " I also
will burn my body." She came and prepared to leap into the flames ;
but the King went near unto her, and caught her by the hand. He
said unto her, " If this, then why that ? If that, then why this ? "
Said she to him, " Let me go free, I will burn my body." Again
said she to him, " By such and such a spring dwelleth my milk-
sister. She will tell thee the meaning of this." So he let her go,
and she was burnt beside her husband, and became released from
the sorrows of the world. Next day went forth the King, and came
to that spring. There saw he a certain woman, and to her he said,
" If that, then why this ? If this, then why that ? " The woman
made reply, " After eight days will I give to thee the answer."

5. Said my Master : â€”

Eight days passed, and then the King called to mind the
woman's words. He ran to the spring. There saw he her and again
asked he of her the meaning of those words. Quoth she, " Go
thou, and bring hither a goat and a jar." He brought the goat
and the jar, and then said she, " Descend thou into this spring
and therein set thou the jar upside-down." And further said she
to him, " Lead thou down the goat by the ear, and put its head
upon the jar." (He did so), and she cried, " Strike thou it a blow
with the sword."

6. And my Master said : â€”

He struck it a blow with his sword, and on the instant did the
King of a sudden disappear.

7. And furthermore my Master told me : â€”

He found himself in a garden, and there was there spread a
bed. On the bed he climbed and lay down and fell asleep. Now
there were fairies there. They lifted him up and carried him off
into a certain place. There he awoke, and seeth all round him

a region of paradise. Fair women were dancing there, and smitten
with love for the entrancing spectacle did the King become.

8. And further saith my Master : â€”

Departed these fairies and left him all alone, but before they
went gave they him a key. Said they to him, " Unlock thou this
room. Arise, and go within." He went within, and there he saw .
a horse ready saddled. He led it without, and stood there holding
it by the bridle. Said they to him, " Mount this horse." He
mounted it, and, lo ! at once he seeth everything that God, the
Master, hath made both below the seven earths and above the
seven heavens. All that did the King see, and for it did he become
smitten with love. Then before him appeared Satan ; and Satan
asked him saying, " What is it thou dost see ? " Quoth the
King, " Whatever God, the Master, hath created, that do I see."
And Satan said to him in answer, " More than this will I show thee.
Behold, here is my key. With it unlock thou this door. Arise and
go within." The King went within and there saw he an ass tied.
Said Satan to him, " Bring thou it forth, and mount it, and thou
shalt see something more even than all that God, the Master, hath
created." Thereupon did the King mount that ass.

9. Furthermore said my Master : â€”

Straightway the ass carried the King back unto his palace.
He dismounted and went upstairs, and when he came down again,
behold, he saw no ass there. Great longing for that garden of
paradise came unto the King, but how was he to reach it ? They
tell me that he went at once unto the spring and asked the woman,
" Tell me, prithee, 'If that, then why this ? If this, then why that ? ' "
And that woman said unto him, " Bring thou thine own son, and
bring also a pitcher, and also bring thy sword." Said she to him,
" Descend thou into this spring, and take down with thee thy son.
Cast him down, and upon the pitcher lay thou his head." So the
King took the lad by the ear, and drew his sword. With it would
he have struck his son had not the woman seized it. Cried she,
" This it is that is that ; and that it is that is this. Thou becamest
smitten with love for the garden, and my sister became smitten
with love for the beggarman."

IV. A SONG OF LAL MALIK

1. He saith : â€”

God, supplication make I unto thee. Ah ! hear Thou me !
For this world is a deluder.



2. First sent He the holy Adam ; yea, by the Angels was he
made complete. Then Iblis ruined him, and thence (i.e. from
Paradise) was he thrust forth. This world is a deluder.



3. From Adam was sprung the holy Noah, and from him the
infidels became estranged. A sigh he uttered, and the whole
universe was flooded in his tears. This world is a deluder.



4. In no way less than him was the holy Jesus. He was
the beloved friend of God, the Master. Seated upon the four heavens
did He utter His teaching. This world is a deluder.



5. The holy Moses stepped forward, crying, " I would see the
Master with mine own eyes." He gave forth (the ten) words from
Mount Sinai. This world is a deluder.



6. In no way less than him was the holy Abraham, who forbad
the worship of idols. He it was who established the faith of
Muhammad. This world is a deluder.



7. When I shall die, and my brethren and friends will lower
me into the grave, then what can they show to me, Lai Malik, but
that this world is a deluder.

V. THE TALE OF THE GOLDSMITH

1. Now this is what my Master saith : â€”

In days of yore there was a certain city, wherein there lived a
goldsmith. He was head of his guild with twelve hundred guilds-
men under him. He used to make articles for the King's daughter,
and these his wife would take to her. One day the princess told
the goldsmith's wife that in future her husband must himself
bring the things, so one day he set out to her with a ring. When
the princess saw it she took exception to it. " It is crooked," said
she. So he took it back and went home, and there fell sick.

2. The truth was that he had fallen in love with the princess,
and she too had become enamoured of him. She cried to her
foster-mother : â€”

" Full of sweet languishment is that son of a goldsmith.
I have seen him, nurse, and mad is my longing for him."

But the foster-mother replied : â€”

" Utter not, daughter, childish talk,
Or thou wilt be caught within the net of love.
Close thine ear, daughter, to such words,
Or else thou wilt find thyself a mark for blame."



3. The goldsmith lay sick of the fever of love, and his wife was
a clever woman. She understood the cause of his pain, and said
to him, " Practise thou pitching balls, and make two balls of gold."

4. Saith my Master : â€”

So he made two balls of gold and went out holding (them and
other) balls in his hand. Hither and thither he pitched balls of
stone and balls of iron as he went along, till he came below the
princess's window, and through it he flung into her lap-cloth the
two balls of gold. On this she turned her back towards him and
showed him a mirror. Then she threw some water out of the
window. Then she threw out a posy of flowers, and again a hair.

Finally she lifted up an iron stiletto and with it scratched the sill
of the window. When the goldsmith had seen all this he returned
home, and his wife said to him, " Well, dear, what did you do ? "
Said he to her, " I flung, my dear, the balls to her, and they fell,
my dear, into her lap-cloth. Then, my dear, she turned her back to
me and showed me a mirror. Then, my dear, she threw some water
out of the window. Then she threw out a posy of flowers, and
then a hair. Then she made a scratch upon the window-sill with
an iron stiletto." Replied she, " When she turned her back and
showed the mirror, she meant that someone else was there ; when
she threw out water, she meant that you must come in by the water-
drain ; when she threw the posy of flowers, she meant that it was
the garden into which you must come ; when she showed the
stiletto, she meant that you must bring a file, as there are iron
railings to be cut through ; and when she threw a hair, she meant
that she was combing her locks."



At eventide the goldsmith went forth, and entered the garden.
There he found a bed and got up on to it. He was weak from
illness, and fell asleep. While he so slept, there came the princess.
From the pillow she walked to the foot of the bed, and from the foot
back again to the pillow, but he never awoke to welcome her. By
that time the dawn began to blossom forth, and the princess ran
off home. Thereafter the goldsmith awoke, and returned to his
house. Says his wife to him, " What, dear, did you do ? " Says
he in reply, " She never came to me." Says she to him, " Come
here, my dear." He went up to her, and she looked into his pocket,
and found there the two golden balls that on the day before he had
thrown into the princess's lap-cloth. Says she to him, " She did
come to you, but you never stayed awake. Now, when you go
again this evening, I will tell you what to do."

6. And the Master further told me : â€”

She set to work paring the ten nails of his hands, and as she did
so, she gave to one of them a deep gash. Cried he, " You've been
and killed me!" But she replied. " I was never taught barber's

work by my father and mother. When you go to-day, I'll give
you a little remedy." So she gave him some red-pepper and salt,
saying, " Next time you get up on to that bed and you feel sleepy,
apply a little of this medicine to your cut finger and your sleep will
become cool." l

So the goldsmith went out, taking with him the medicine, and
came to the garden, and got up on to the bed. He waited a long
time, yet no one ever came. At length he began to feel
sleepy, but his hand was too sore, and he caught hold of it (to
relieve the pain). He said to himself, " She hasn't come. If
I had only put some of that medicine on my sore finger I should
have had a cool and refreshing sleep." So he put some of the
medicine on the cut, and the smart was like a fiery poison in his
heart. He jumped up, nursing his aching hand.

7. And my Master went on to say : â€”

Just then came the princess, and all his pain was forgotten. He
did with her what was proper to the occasion, and they fell asleep
in each other's arms. Meantime the dawn began to blossom forth.
The chief constable came by on his rounds of inspection, and found
there the princess and the goldsmith. He arrested them, making
them over to his henchmen, and put them into jail. Just then
a man happened to be passing along the road, and they called out
to him, " Please, sir, make an outcry in the goldsmiths' market.
You must say, ' The King's ass has trespassed in the saffron field,
and who knows whether they will cut off its tail or cut its throat.' '
" The King's ass was caught in the saffron field,
And as I went there, my heart became all full of anxiety.
Thou must come at dawn with money to pay the fine,
Otherwise the King will kill.it there and then."
The goldsmith's wife heard this outcry. She went out into the
market and bought some loaves. She put these into a deep basket,
and went off (to the jail), crying : â€”

" In six prisons have I distributed loaves.
Now, God, would I enter a seventh."

1 She means that the desire for sleep would become cool, and he would
remain awake. But the silly fellow misunderstands her, and imagines that
the medicine would bring him cool and refreshing sleep.

8. And my Master said : â€”

She went about distributing these loaves, saying, " My husband
is sick. And what did holy men and medicants say to me but to
distribute loaves in seven jails. If ye have ought to say to me,
say it to me as I go in ; but say not ought to me as I go out, for
that will risk the fulfilment of my vow." And then she continued,
" I wonder if ye' have any prisoners herein." They replied, " At
the last watch of the night the chief constable brought hither two
prisoners. They are in there at the back." So she came up to
them, and said to her husband, " How can we now get the princess
free ? Have you any plan for releasing her ? " Said he, " If
I had any plan, would I now be in prison ? "

9. Said my Master : â€”

She took off her clothes and put them on the princess, and took
off the princess's clothes and put them on herself. Then she
turned the basket upside down (over the princess's head, so as to
conceal it) and the princess went straight out of the jail, and came
home. In the meantime the chief constable reported to the King
that the princess and goldsmith had been found in the garden,
and, of course, had been put in prison. The King went forth
into the judgment hall. They brought the two prisoners before
him, and, lo and behold, they were the husband and wife !
The goldsmith's wife respectfully folded her arms and said to
the King, " Your Majesty, we had gone to a marriage feast, and
on our way back happened to pass through this city of yours.
It was then late, so we went into your garden. There we chanced
to see a bed, and got on to it and went to sleep. Well, your chief
constable came along, and, as you see, arrested us and put us into
prison." Then the chief constable got up and said to the King,
" Your Majesty, let your Majesty's daughter make oath at the
Vigifiah Nag. 1 People say that if anyone make a false oath there,
he never rises up again, but falls down dead on the spot."

Said the goldsmith's wife to the goldsmith, " Have you any plan
for saving the princess ? " Said he to her, " Please tell me how ? "

1 Vigifiah or Vigin u is the name of the tutelary goddess of the Kashmir
forests. In the good old times she was often seen as she roamed over the
mountains, but nowadays she is always invisible. A Vigifiah Nag is a Nag,
or spring, sacred to her.

Said she, " In the first place, pull off all your clothes, and put wooden
pattens on your feet. In the second place, rub ashes over your
whole body, and pretend to be a mendicant devotee. As soon as
they shall bring the princess to the Nag, you must go up to her and
catch hold of her skirt, saying, " First of all, pray give me alms."
She can then safely take oath and say, " holy Viginah Nag, save
and except this mad fellow no one hath ever seized my skirt." 1

She went down to bathe in the Viginah Nag.
" I know not why this charge was brought against me.
Only this mad one hath caught the skirt of my garment."
Then what happened to the vile chief constable ?
All the folk took their several ways to their homes.
Then what happened to the vile chief constable ?

10. So the princess went home in peace, and they took the chief
constable and impaled him. The goldsmith and his wife also
returned to their own house, and there he fell sick. He was sick
with the fever of love for the princess. But the goldsmith's wife
was very clever. She made a necklace worth a hundred dinars
and put it on her husband. She dressed herself as a mendicant
ascetic, and him as a dancing girl, and brought him to the King's
palace. Said she to the King, " Here is my brother's wife, and I
am putting her in thy charge. I must be off to my brother who has
gone away on a trading expedition. So here is my dancing girl
placed in thy charge until I return. She is yet a virgin and thou
must keep her with thine own daughter." Saying this she (left the
goldsmith there disguised as the girl and) returned to her own
house. Shortly afterwards the goldsmith himself slipped away,
and also went home.

11. And again my Master said : â€”

The goldsmith's wife dresses her husband up as a merchant,
and arrives as if from a journey at the King's city. She herself is
again made up as the mendicant ascetic. She leaves the pretended

1 "To seize the skirt" has also a metaphorical meaning, which can be
imagined. Hence, the princess was quite safe in saying it.

merchant in the tent, and herself goes to the King. She makes
her petition to him. " Give me," said she, " my dancing girl." The
King replies with abuse, and throws curses at her eyes, but she
reiterates, " Give me my dancing girl " : â€”

" Longing have I been for my girl as the days went by.
The mendicant has come for his dancing girl."
And the King replies to her : â€”

" mendicant, fix not the banner of thy claim, tol-lol-lay.
I will give thee another lady in compensation, tol-lol-lay."

But the mendicant answers : â€”

" An ascetic I am without worldly ties, tol-lol-lay.
In compensation I'll take thine own daughter, tol-lol-lay."

12. And finally said my Master : â€”

He made a necklace worth a hundred dinars, and putting it on
his own daughter, made her over to the mendicant ascetic.
Taradiddle, taradiddle, tol-lol-lay,
It is only womenfolk who can act this way.
She took the princess and made her over to her husband. And
she said to them, " You must learn, and she must learn." x

1 i.e. learn the truth of the verse jusb quoted. They two must learn and
know the power of women's wiles. There is perhaps an indication that the
wiles would continue, and that the life of the husband and of the second wife
might not be happy as they expected.

VI. THE STORY OF YUSUF AND ZULAIKHA 1

1. Wilt thou not hear, beloved, (the tale of) Yusuf and

Zulaikha ?

2. (Zulaikha) " To the feast wilt thou not come ? Dainty meats

wilt thou not eat ?
In season or out of season, come thou to me. Wilt thou not
hear, beloved ?

3. " Seven rooms have I in the palace ; in my longing for thee

have I prepared them.
Sit thou, I pray, for but a moment. Wilt thou not hear,
beloved ? "

4. One by one she herself in the idol-house

Covereth (each idol) with a veil. 2 Wilt thou not hear, beloved ?

5. (Yusuf) " On what hast thou put a veil ? What hast thou

displayed to us ? "
(Zulaikha) " It is my god (that I have veiled). Wilt thou not
hear, beloved ? "

6. (Yusuf) " There is but one God. Cast from thy mind the

belief in dualism. 3
He is burning bright as a lamp. Wilt thou not hear,
beloved ?

7. " There is but one God, who hath manifested Himself in glory.
What purpose can there be in a stone ? Wilt thou not hear,

beloved ? "

8. The holy Yusuf fled, and after him ran Zulaikha.

Yusuf fleeing, Zulaikha pursuing.
Cried she, " Is it thus that thou shouldest act ? Wilt thou not
hear, beloved ? "

9. She caught him by the neck. She made an accusation

against him.
They went before the King. Wilt thou not hear, beloved ?

1 Yasuf is Joseph, and Zulaikha is Potiphar's wife.

2 When Zulaikha tempts Joseph she puts a veil before the image of her
household idol, that it may not become aware of her unchastity. This arouses
Joseph's suspicions.

3 D8y, duality, is a technical term of Kashmiri Saiva monotheism, and is
here borrowed by Musalman theology.

10. AzIz-8 Misr was the King, and he had enmity against Yiisuf.
Yiisuf is in prison, no one heareth his complaint.

But he will be released by the power of God. Wilt thou not
hear, beloved ?

11. When Yiisuf was put in prison there were there old
prisoners. They each saw a dream. To one he interpreted it,
saying, " Of a surety the King will kill thee," and the King did
kill him. To the other he made interpretation saying, " Thou wilt
become the King's chief clerk. Then, sir, I beseech thee, bear thou
me in mind."

The prisoners saw a dream. The interpretation turned out

true * for them.
On the morrow they were released from jail. Wilt thou not

hear, beloved ?

12. King Aziz-e Misr saw a dream.
Aziz-e Misr became terrified by the dream.

He awoke, and there was made proclamation. Wilt thou not
hear, beloved ?

13. What was the purport of the proclamation ?

Among the priests, among the calendars, among the saints,

among the mendicants.
Can there not be found one learned man ? Wilt thou not hear,

beloved ?

14. Of what science was a learned man required ? One who
could interpret this dream that had been seen by Aziz-e Misr.
His servant said to him, " The holy Yiisuf knoweth how to interpret
a dream."

" Mighty is Yiisuf in interpretation of dreams.
Verily he is the remedy of all pains. Wilt thou not hear,
beloved ? "

15. They brought the holy Yiisuf, and the King said to him,
" I have seen a certain dream. Tell thou me the interpretation
thereof." Said Yusuf, " What didst thou see ? " Replied the
King, " In the first place saw I seven dry water-springs drinking

unripe ears of corn swallowing up seven ripe ears. Again I saw
coming seven lean kine, and they were swallowing up seven fat
kine. Tell thou me the interpretation of this." And Yiisuf said
unto him, " A famine will arise."

16. And my Master said : â€”

Yiisuf finished telling the interpretation, and as he did so
the power of the famine seized the King. He felt hunger, and cried
out, " Give me food," although that was not his time for eating.
Through the power of the famine he cried to them, " Speedily bring
ye it to me." And people say that they hastened forth and brought
him food. He ate it, and cried, " Bring ye more ! " They hauled
it to him in cauldrons, and he ate it but could not be satisfied.
And people say that (for all he ate) he died of starvation. They
say that next day the Viziers gave forth this command, " Let all
ye citizens descend to-morrow to the 'Id-plain, and he to whom the
royal elephant will bow, and on whose thumb-ring the royal
hawk will alight, shall become King. They say that they went
down to the 'Id-plain. The elephant came and bowed to Yiisuf,
and the hawk came and alighted on his thumb-ring. So Yiisuf
became King.

Majesty he displayed, he sent for the elephant.

Yusuf became King. Wilt thou not hear, beloved ?

Ever as thou goest recite the creed. Wilt thou not hear,

VII. THE TALE OF THE REED-FLUTE

1. Only to him is the burden of woe manifested who suffereth

woe himself.
The reed-flute herself is telling the reed-flute's woe.

2. Quoth the reed-flute, " The Almighty is one and only one.
God alone is of His own will devoid of wrath."

3. Quoth the reed-flute, " Pure is the Almighty ;

(As He alone is free from imperfection) only towards Himself
can he yearn day and night.

4. " Ever go ye giving forth praise to that God,

In that He created Muhammad, the Beloved Guest.

5. " The Almighty gave him instruments to be with him.

Four friends 1 are illustrious as his companions.

6. "By His glory He created Adam,

And with Adam was created this world." 2

7. Quoth the reed-flute, " Adam was sent forth into the world

all alone,
And at his wish Eve issued from his side."

8. Quoth the reed-flute, " How excellent was that moment,
In which the world with all its offspring was created ! "

9. Quoth the reed-flute, " Hear ye, I pray, the tale of my woe.
If ye suffer pain, remain, I pray, a moment by me."

10. Quoth the reed-flute, " At the back of the forest was I hidden,
Beautiful with my branches and my leaves."

11. Quoth the reed-flute, " Upright was my youthful form,

As (in the breeze) I waved the pendants of my golden ears.

12. " I went astray, and thus happened that change of my estate.

A woodcutter chanced upon me, a doom, a thief of my
destiny."

1 Muhammad's four friends were Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthman, and 'All.
The last two were his sons-in-law, and the first two his dearest friends.

 The word yldam is a corruption of the Sanskrit idam, and comes
curiously in a Musalman poem.

And how much humiliation doth he cast upon my fair young

16. Far from the forest was she sundered, and of that sundering

she tells.
Lamenting was she, as she made her last farewell.

17. "Down from the mountain forest he bringeth me, and wearieth

me with the long, long road.
And when he is come down, he selleth me to a carpenter." l

18. Quoth the reed-flute, " He turneth me round and round

sideways and inspecteth me.
He standeth apart and giveth me terrible blows with an axe."

19. Quoth the reed-flute, " When he melted my flesh with a saw,
When he set me on his lathe, 'twas as though a wood-worm

had attacked me."

20. When she was set on the lathe in that carpenter's shop, the
memory of her friends and companions comes to her. She says some
words to them. What is it she would say ?

Quoth the reed-flute, " Where stayed my friends and

companions ?
Messages would I send them. Would that I knew if they

stayed half way.

21. "I would tell my secret to my friends and neighbours,

I would open my bosom, and display my grief."

22. Quoth the reed-flute, "What hath befallen me! How

much do I lament !
In my woe, I pour forth cries and calls for help."

1 A torka-chdn is a carpenter who works on his own account in his own
workshop, and who is not a village servant.

23. Quoth the reed-flute, " In the assemblies cries would I give

forth.
No man or woman ever liveth free from his fated sorrow."

24. And my Master saith : â€”

What would she have said to her friends and companions ?
To them verily would she have said this : â€”

" He planed me and he made me smooth, and with an auger
bored he my body.
Prithee, behold me well. How much of my flesh is dropping
from me !

25. " Shall I not weep ? Holes hath he made all o'er my body.

For a petty farthing how often hath he stretched his arms
upon me."

26. Moreover my Master saith : â€”

When she had been sold for petty farthings there came to her
the memory of the canebrake where she was born. She addresses
some words to it. What is it she would say ?

Quoth the reed-flute, " Yearning have I for my canebrake,
For this purpose searched I earth and heaven."

27. Quoth the reed-flute, " How fair is my canebrake !

Can one who knoweth it not, understand its meaning, if he
hear thereof ? "

28. Quoth the reed-flute, " How excellent is my canebrake !
Can an ignorant man understand its meaning, if he hear

thereof % "

29. Quoth the reed-flute, " He only will have knowledge of my

canebrake
Who hath arrived at the true knowledge of God the Omni-
present."

30. Quoth the reed-flute, " What hath been said in these verses ?
Only he will understand on whom hath fallen a particle of

love."

31. Quoth the reed-flute, " Many are they who drink sweet wine,
But only on Sodarbal doth Subhan sing the tale of the reed-
flute."

VIII. THE TALE OF A KING

1. Once upon a time there was a certain King, and my Master
tells me that every day he used to go out to take the air in the roof
summer-house of his palace. Now some birds had built their
nests in its thatch, and each day the King and Queen used to listen
to the chirping of the chicks, and much joy did the two derive
therefrom. One day they heard none, and said the Queen to the
King, " Why is there to-day no chirping?" And my Master tells
me that they looked into the nest, and that they found therein only
two dead chicks. They took them out and full of grief brought
them down into the palace. There they summoned all their wise
Viziers, and commanded them to inspect the dead chicks, and to
say what had happened to them. So the Viziers inspected them,
and found that a thorn had been stuck into the throat of each.
Then said a very sage among the Viziers, "It is evident that the
mother of these chicks died, and that the cock sought another mate
and wedded her. She has been giving each of them a thorn to
eat for food, and that is why they are dead." Said the King to
the Queen, " If I die, thou must not wed again," and said the Queen
to the King, " If / die, thou must not wed again." And so they
mutually made vow and oath. Now, why was it that they made
this vow and oath ? â€¢ " Because," said they, " we have two sons, and
who knoweth but a stepmother or a stepfather may do this very
thing to them."

2. In the course of time the Queen died, and the King wedded
not again, because of the mutual vow and oath that the Queen and
he had made. A long time passed, and at length his Viziers came
to him and said, " Verily, your Majesty should once more make
espousal," but for a long time he paid no heed to them. Then at
last his Viziers became urgent, and he took to himself a new Queen.

3. Now, as we have heard, there were two young princes, and
they were occupied in their lessons. One day the two brethren
took advice of each other and decided to bring a complimentary
present to their stepmother. So they filled a tray with rubies and
other jewels and offered it to her. She accepted the tray, and as
she did so her glance fell upon them. The princes then went off

to their lessons, and after that, day by day, they brought her a
similar offering. One day, there arose in the heart of the Queen
a passionate desire for the two youths, and she made proposals to
them for an unlawful intrigue ; but they replied, " Thou art our
mother ! We are thy children ! Between thee and us such may
not be," and went off again to their lessons. In the evening the
King came to the harem, but the Queen locked the door of her room
and refused to allow him to enter. Said he, " Why hast thou shut
the door ? " and she replied to him, "Is it of thee that I am the
wife, or am I the wife of thy two sons ? " Said the King, " What
is it that hath happened ? " Replied she, " They came to me and
asked of me indecent things. Nor will I open the door to thee till
thou give me their two hearts."

4. And my Master saith : â€”

He gave an order to his Viziers while the boys were studying
their lessons in the school. Said he to the Viziers, " Make the
princes over to the executioners, and let the executioners kill them."
And my Master tells me that a Vizier went to the princes, and
became filled with pity for them. Said he to them, " Come ye down
from the school." Then he said, " Flee ye from this city." So they
fled, and then the Vizier did a deed. He told the executioners to
kill two dogs. So they killed two dogs, and tore out their hearts.
These they put upon a charger and took to the Queen. Said they
to her, " Here are the two hearts of those princes. Open thou the
door and take them." So she opened the door and took the two
hearts, as they said to her, "Here are they for thee straight from the
bodies of the two princes." And thereafter the King lived on with
her to sway the sceptre.

5. The two brothers sought refuge with another king, and he
said to them, " Ye appear unto me to be princes. Prithee tell ye
me how are ye come hither, and what is the cause thereof." So
they told him all their happenings, and he thereupon took them
into his service. And my Master tells me that they were entered
into the King's bodyguard. The King had already two old servants
in his bodyguard, and with these two princes they made four.
Each had to guard the king during one of the four watches of the

night. Now the first watch of the night fell to the elder of the two
princes, and my Master tells me that at this time the King and
Queen went to their bed.



6. Furthermore, my Master tells me : â€”

The guard stood by, watching and warding the royal pair, and
straight in front of them he saw a great python begin to lower
itself from the ceiling. He fixed his eyes upon it, and as it
approached the body of the Queen he ran up and struck at it with
his sword. He hacked it into little pieces and thrust them under
the bed. He then wrapped the blade of his sword in cotton-wool,
and some of this he used to wipe the body of the Queen, " For,"
said he to himself, " haply some of the python's poison may have
touched her." This, you must understand, was his sole and only
reason for wiping her. But just then the King awoke, and he saw
that his guard had come near him with a naked sword in his hand.
By this time the period of his watch had passed, and the watch
of the second guard was due. He approached, and the King said
to him, " guard, what should be done to the man who is traitor
to his lord ? " Replied the guard, " Sire, his head should be cut
off, and he should be flayed alive. But, your Majesty, I would
tell to thee a story. Prithee, lend thou me thine ear."

7. Said the guardsman : â€”

" Once upon a time there was a King. One day he went a-hunting
all alone. He took with him his falcon, and when he had come to
a certain spot he fell athirst, but could find no means of alleviation.
A length he saw in one place a little moisture (on the face of a cliff).
He thrust in his spear to make a hole, and pulled forth a cup from
his pocket, which he filled with the water as it trickled forth. As
he began to take it up to drink his falcon flew at him and upset it.
So he filled the cup again, and was about to drink when again the
falcon upset it. Poisonous anger rose in the heart of the King. The
third time he filled the cup, holding it with his right hand, leaving
his left arm free. Just as he began to drink, again came the falcon

and upset it. The King grasped the bird, and holding it under his
feet tore off both its wings. As soon as he had killed it he was rilled
with regret, and could not drink the water. He went to look for
the source of the spring, and when he had found it he saw there
a huge python lying asleep, and from its mouth spittle was dripping
into the streamlet. The water was poisonous." And, added the
guard to His Majesty, "If that King had drunk that water he would
have died, and if he had only inquired into the matter beforehand
he would not have killed the falcon. Sire, that is my story. Thou
shouldst scrutinize before deciding."

8. His watch also came to an end, and there came the third
watch. The first two sat down to rest themselves, but the King
was still wakeful, and he spoke to his third guard, saying, " guard,
what should be done to him who showeth faithlessness to his
lord ? " Said he in answer, " He should be stoned to death, but
first, sire, investigation should be made. I would tell to thee a story.
Lend thou me, sire, thine ear."

9. Said the third guardsman : â€”

" There was once upon a time a merchant blessed with all
prosperity. But evil times befell him, so that he had naught
left of his possessions but a dog. Another merchant asked him if
he would sell it, and thereto did he agree. ' What is the price ? '
and they fixed it at a hundred rupees. So the second merchant
paid the price and took away the dog. Shortly afterwards he went
on a journey with some goods to do merchanting, and halted for
the night at a certain place. In the night-time there came thieves
and took away all his property. The dog watched them, but made
no sound. When the morn blossomed forth the merchant awoke,
and could not find his goods. While he was wondering what had
befallen him, the dog came up and caught hold of his coat and pulled
it. The dog led him out, going in front, while the merchant followed
along behind. He brought him to a certain plain, and there he saw
the spot where the thieves had stored his goods. He recognized
them, and brought back to his lodging not only what had been
taken from him, but all that these thieves had stolen from other
merchants. He was filled with joy, and said to himself, ' That

merchant was not able to put the true value on his dog. Hard times
had fallen on him, and he had to take what he could get."

10. Moreover my Master said : â€”

" He put the value of the dog at five hundred rupees, and wrote
a note of hand to that amount. This he tied to the dog's neck,
and told him to go home with it to his old master. The dog set
forth and arrived at his old master's house. The latter saw him and
recognized him. He said to his people, ' Here is this dog come back.
No doubt he hath done some fault. Moreover, there is an invoice
to that effect tied to his neck.' So he became filled with anxiety.
' What,' cried he, * am I to do ? For I have spent the hundred
rupees.' So he went and got a gun, fired it at the dog, and killed
it. When he had killed it, he felt sorry and went up to look at
the paper that was tied to its neck. When he took it off and
opened it he saw written on it an order for five hundred rupees.
Then, indeed, he felt very sorry. Your Majesty, that is my story.
One should always scrutinize. If that merchant had first looked
to see what was tied to the dog's neck he would not have killed it."

With that the term of his watch expired.

11. Now came the watch of the fourth guard, and this is his
story. The King said to the fourth guard, " guard, what should
be done to the man who is a traitor to his lord ? " Replied the
guard, " Your Majesty, his head should be cut off, and he should
be banished from the city. But, sire, I would tell thee a story.
Lend thou me thine ear."

And the fourth guardsman said : â€”

" Once upon a time there was a King who had two sons. Their
mother died, and the King made a second marriage, and thus gave
the two princes a stepmother. While they were still at their lessons
they brought her a tray filled with rubies and other jewels as a
complimentary present. They laid it before her, and then went
back to their lessons. They passed each day in this manner, and
at length a design was aroused in the Queen. And this was her
design. She said to herself, ' I would do sin with these young
princes.' One day she said to them, ' Come ye and do sin with

me ' ; but they replied, ' Thou art our mother, between thee and us
such may not be,' and then went off to their lessons. After this
the King came home, when he had dismissed his court, and went
to the harem ; but the Queen locked the door against him and
refused to open it. Said he, * What meaneth this ? ' Then up and
answered she, ' Is it of thee that I am the wife, or am I the wife
of thy two sons ? ' Said the King, ' What is it that hath happened ? '
Said she, ' They came to me and asked of me indecent things.'
Said he, ' What wouldest thou have me to do ? ' and she replied,
' I must have their two hearts, that I may eat them. Then, and then
only, will I open for thee the door.' So the King gave the command
to his Vizier, and said to him, ' Make these two princes over to the
executioners, that they may tear out both their hearts.' So the
Vizier took his leave and came to the school where the princes were
doing their lessons. He took one look at them and saw that they
were both exceeding fair to behold, and pity filled his soul. He said
to them, * Flee ye far from this city.' So they fled."

12. And moreover my Master said : â€”

" The Vizier told the executioners to kill two dogs. They did so,
and tore out their hearts, which they placed upon a charger and
carried to the Queen. Then she opened the door, and the King
went in, and there did he sway his sceptre.

13. " The two princes in their flight came to another King, who
appointed them to be his bodyguards. The first watch of the night
falls to the elder prince. A lamp is burning, and shows the King
and Queen asleep upon their bed. Straight in front of them is
descending a huge python. The guard draws his sword, and hacks
it into little pieces. After this he wraps up the blade of his sword
in cotton- wool, and some of this he uses to wipe off the python's
poison from the body of the Queen. ' For,' said he to himself,

IX. THE TALE OF THE FARMER'S WIFE AND THE

HONEY-BEE

1. Saith my Master : â€”

Here was a farmer's wife who had fled from her home. And why
had she done this ? It was because the village overseer and the
headman had shown her tyranny, and so she had fled. She reached
a forest, and there there came a honey-bee. Behold, speech came to
the honey-bee, and she saith to the farmer's wife, " Why hast thou
fled ? " And she replied that tyranny had been shown to her.
Then answered her the honey-bee, " I also have suffered tyranny,
and therefore do I lament. Prithee, lend thou me thine ear." And
thus speaketh the honey-bee to the farmer's wife : â€”

Prithee hither come, my friend. Let us fall at God's feet, and

make our prayers to Him.
Lo, I am thy honey-bee, a poor winged creature of the forest.

2. From hill to hill did I collect my flower-nectar, and become

possessed of manifold progeny.
May ruin seize that ruthless bear, for he it was that drove me to
the forests.

3. He utterly destroyed my little ones. God, why came there

no pity to Thee ?
Lo, I am thy honey-bee, a poor winged creature of the forest.

4. Quoth the honey-bee to the farmer's wife, " Thus and thus
was I driven from the forest by the bear, and now I fled. Then
alighted I at a farmer's house, and he said unto me, ' I will give
thee peace and comfort.' Behold what that farmer did unto me.
Prithee, lend thou me thine ear. What shall I say unto thee ? "
He made ready a hive as an abode for me, and rubbed it o'er with

fresh butter. It became a prison of death for me.
It was my fate that brought me to the farmer's house, and, of
a truth, that fate was humiliation.

5. With a sickle he cut off my honey-combs, and thereby there
rose upon him the guilt of countless murders.
Lo, I am thy honey-bee, a poor winged creature of the forest.

IX. FARMERS WIFE AND HONEY-BEE

6. So finished that honey-bee the story of her pain, and now
saith she to that farmer's wife, " If aught hath happened unto thee,
do thou also tell it." Then speaketh the farmer's wife and saith
to her, " Hear what hath happened unto me."

Each soul must dree its weird, and there is a place below to

which it must descend.
Lo, I am thy farmer's wife. We came not to this world as an

abiding place.

7. In the spring the tax-gatherers came to the farmers with soft

encouragement.
With sweet words did they fill their bellies, and enclosed them
as in a net.

8. In the autumn they forgot all their kindness. They it was who

came to beat us.
Lo, I am thy farmer's wife. We came not to this world as an
abiding place.

9. Crops sowed I in mother earth, and they it was that sprung up

and ripened.
I collected and piled them on the threshing-floor, hundreds of
kharwdrs l in weight.

10. From village-circuit to village-circuit to weigh the produce

came the headman and the accountant.
Lo, I am thy farmer's wife. We came not to this world as an
abiding place.

11. How many of the poor and needy, friend, came as beggars

holding out their lap-cloths !
Their skirts I filled and filled, for that giveth an assurance of
salvation.

12. The recording angels will write down with their pens the reward

of these good actions, so that they may ne'er be shaken.
Lo, I am thy farmer's wife. We came not to this world as an
abiding place.

1 A kharwdr weighs about a hundredweisrht and a half.

X. THE TALE OF RAJA VIKRAMADITYA l

1. This is what my Master saith to me : â€”

Four men were once going along the road, and they came to a
wide open plain. As they entered it they began to say to each
other, " Come, let us tell a story to while away the journey across
the plain." After a time they were joined by another man, and they
asked him to tell a story to help the journey along. Said he, " Sirs,
I will tell you a story. Moreover, sirs, as a story I will tell you five
things, 2 but for the five things you must pay me five hundred
rupees." Replied they, " We are four, and will give thee four
hundred. The fifth hundred must be paid by thee as the fifth of
us. So tell us, prithee, sir, the five things." Said he to them : â€”
V Money, sirs, is for a journey.

A friend, sirs, is for when there is no money.

A near relation, sirs, is for when there is money.
That makes three things, and, sirs, there are two others : â€”

Thou canst only call thy wife thine own so long as she be
with thee.
And, again, sirs : â€”

He only will win Raja Vikramaditya's daughter

Who keepeth awake by night."
When he told them these five things, they say to him, " Now,
sir, tell a story." But he replies, " I have told you, sirs, the five
things." At this they began to quarrel. Cry they, " You have
taken our four hundred rupees ; but, sir. you have not told us
any story. We have not yet got across the plain." So the four
gave him a drubbing. Then he made this proposal, " Come, sirs,
to the King of this country, and let us abide by what he says."

1 The Indian monarch of glorious, pious, and immortal memory. He is
throughout entitled "Raja", as opposed to the Musalman word " Padshah "
used for the real hero of the stor\\ In translating I retain "Raja"
unchanged, and translate "Padshah" by "King".

2 The whole of the subsequent quarrel depends on the double meaning of
the word kath, which like the Hindi bat means not only "story" but also
" statement" and " thing ". The four thought they were buying five stories,
but the fifth was only selling five statements. I translate kath by " thing ", as
the nearest English word with a similar indefinite meaning. On the other
hand I translate dalll by " story ". Its meaning is not indefinite.

2. Saith my Master : â€”

They went to the King and the four laid their complaint before
him. " This fellow," said they, " hath cheated us to the tune of
four hundred rupees, for he promised to tell us five things."
The King asked him, " What was it that thou saidst to them ? "
And he up and replied, " Sire, I will tell thee the five things, but
thou must pay me for them rupees five hundred. Then, and
only then, can I tell these five things to thee." So the King sent
for five hundred rupees, and gave them to him. (After he had
told them) he tied up the money in his pouch, and the King did
a deed. He doffed his royal garments, and donned those of
beggary. Then he tied seven rubies under his arm and went forth
to test these five things.

3. Moreover my Master said : â€”

First of all he went to the city where dwelt his sister. He mounted
his horse, and when he arrived there he sent her this message,
" I am fallen into poverty ; so what else could I do but come to
thee." And this was the word which she sent back, " Verily, I
shall be put to shame in my father-in-law's house (if thou come to
me)." Again he sent her these words in answer, "If it be not
possible for me to come to thee, thou shouldst at least send me
somewhat wherewith to fill my belly ; and if thou send it, fasten
thou it up carefully, and set thine own seal upon it." So this sister
did a deed. She sent him a little rice in her bowl â€” it may have been
orts, or it may have been fresh food. Upon it she set her own seal,
and despatched it to her brother. As soon as he saw his sister's
seal he accepted it, and there and then he buried it and hid it in
the ground.

4. Then he set forth upon the road to his friend. When he came
near he sent a man on to say, " My friend, I am come to thee.
I have no more royal state, for I have been struck by the blow of
poverty." And when his friend heard this he went forth and came
to his friend, and cried, " Ah, my friend ! Wherefore hast thou
come to show thyself here (so far from my door) ? " So together
the two walk on. As they walked the friend seeth that the
King is clothed in the weeds of poverty, and saith to him, " My

friend, prithee present me with this royal robe that thou dost wear,
and put on my poor garment instead thereof." For he looked upon
the King's garb not as the garb of beggary, but thought of it as a
royal robe. And wherefore that ? It was because of the love he
bare him. They went on and reached the friend's house, and there
the friend made him a feast â€” such a feast as one should lay before
a King.

In this way the King had tested two of the things.

5. Then went he forth to the city where dwelt his wife. When
he had reached the outskirts he made his lodging in the house of an
old woman, and asked of her a sickle that he might cut grass for his
horse. So he went out to fetch the fodder, and came to a mead
where he began to cut the grass. Now this mead was in the home
farm of the king of that land, and the grooms ran up and seized
him, and carried him to their officer, the Master of the Horse.
They shut him up in prison, and when night fell he seeth a woman
coming along with a dish of dainty meats for the Master of the
Horse. He was sitting on a bedstead. She laid the dish before him,
and they both sat down upon the floor to eat it. A few scraps
remained over, and these they gave the prisoner. They called to
him, " Ho, thou prisoner, eat thou these scraps and orts of ours."
The prisoner accepted them and ate. And while he remained
sitting by himself the two clipped and toyed together till the joint
of the bedstead broke. Again they called to the prisoner, " Prithee
see, the joint of this bed hath broken. Haply thou hast wit enough
to mend it." He answered, a Yea, why should I not have wit
therefor ? My neighbours are carpenters." Said they, " Come
hither." So he came, and then the woman recognized him as her
own husband ; though he had recognized her before when they gave
him the scraps of food. So saith she to the Master of the Horse,
" What now are we to do ? This is my husband, he must be killed
this very night of nights." So the Master of the Horse gave his
command to the executioners, " Take ye away this prisoner. He
must be slain. Bring ye us back his heart." So they led him
forth outside the city, and to them made he a petition. " Let me
free," quoth he, " that I may wash my hands and face and make
my prayers to God before I die. So they loosed his bonds, and he

found a little water, wherein he washed his hands and face, and made
his prayers to God, the Master. As he thus did his hands fell upon
the seven rubies that he had tied beneath his arm when setting forth
upon his journey. Then said he to the executioners, " sirs, let
ye me go free. Here be these seven rubies. Keep ye four of them,
one for each of you four, and keep the remaining three for me."

6. In this way he had tested four of the things, but the fifth he
had forgotten. So he returned home, and asketh the five men,
" Sirs, tell ye me what those five things were." Then up and
answered that man, " Sire, how many of these things hast thou
tested ? " Quoth he, " Four." " Which ones ? " they asked.
Said the King: â€”

" True is it â€” a near relation is for when there is money.
True also is it â€” a friend is for when there is no money.
True also is it â€” thou canst only call thy wife thine own so long

as she be with thee.
True also is it â€” money is useful on a journey.

These four things that ye told me have I tested. Now tell ye me
the fifth." Replied that man to him, " A hundred rupees must thou
give me." The King gave it, and he said : â€”

" He only will win Raja Vikramaditya's daughter
Who keepeth awake by night."

7. And the King did a deed. He put on the garb of a mendicant
faqir. He went forth and reached Raja Vikramaditya's palace.
The discerners then discerned him, and the newsmen gave the news
to the Raja. Said they, " Your Majesty, there hath appeared a
faqir, and he saith, ' The Raja's daughter I would win,' " And the
Raja said to them in answer, " Up to to-day, how many princes
have gone to their death ! Now hath this faqir committed himself
to God, that He may decide whether he live or die. Go ye, and lead
ye him up to the chamber." And in the chamber where was the
Raja's daughter, a bed was ready spread. The faqir climbed up
upon it, and gave the lady a push. He conversed with her, and

when they had finished conversing he did a deed. He folded his
garments into the shape of a man, and went a short way off and
sat down to watch. A lamp was burning, and by its light he saw
a python issue from the lady's mouth. 1 It entered the garments
which he had folded into the shape of a man. It shook them, and
bit them over and over again, but when it found that there was no
man within them, it retreated and again entered the lady's mouth.
In this way did the faqir satisfy himself by his perscrutation that
it was within the lady that there was an evil calamity dwelling,
and that there was nought else outside her. Up came the faqir
to the bed. He gave the lady a push, and held converse with her.
He made his garments again into the shape of a man, and again
went away a short distance to sit and watch. A lamp was burning,
and in his hand he held his drawn sword. The python issued from
the lady's mouth, and began to enter the garments. He raised his
sword and smote it to pieces and slew it. He cut it into gobbets
and thrust them under the bed. Then he climbed himself upon
the bed, laid the sword beneath the pillow, and fell asleep.

8. The night came to an end, and dawn began to come, and to
the executioners said Raja- Vikramaditya, "Go ye. This faqir
is surely dead. Bring him too down, as ye did the others. Up to
to-day how many princes have gone to their death, and he, too,
must have died ! " They went up into the chamber, and saw the
faqir alive and safe and sound. The discerners then discerned
him, and the newsmen gave the news to the Raja. Said they,
" Your Majesty, that faqir is of truth alive." His Majesty, the
Raja, himself ascended to the chamber, and made him gratulations,
crying, " faqir, tell me, prithee, how thou didst escape." Quoth
the faqir, " By remaining awake. Your Majesty, cast thou a glance
below the bed." The Raja looked, and there saw he the calamity
as the faqir had thrust it after he had killed it. Said the faqir
to the Raja, " What was the promise made by thee ? " And quoth
the Raja, " True it is. There is no God but the one God." Then

1 Literally, "belly," but as the python certainly came out via the mouth
I use a word more suitable for Western ears when dealing with a lady.

said the faqlr to him, " Here, sire, is this thy daughter. Sire,
give thou me the token (that I may claim her as my wife)." Then
gave the Raja his ring to the faqir, and took in exchange the faqlr's
ring from him.

9. Then departed the faqlr and came to his own city. He put
off his mendicant's weeds and clothed himself in royal robes. He
gave the command to his army to set forth with him.

10. And my Master said : â€”

First of all went he to his sister's city. The king, her husband,
was one of those that paid him tribute. He had his sister brought
to him, and put before her the bowl of food that she had sent to
him on that day, and on which she had set her seal. Quoth he to
her, " Is this thy seal ? " Replied she, " Mine it is." Then said
to her the King, "It is I who was the beggar-man of that day.
True it is that a near relation is for when there is money."

11. He took the army of that king also with him, and turned his
footsteps towards his friend. And the friend made a feast in honour
of the royalty of both these kings. The night they passed there,
and at dawn they again set forth.

12. He turned his footsteps towards the city of his father-in-
law. He sent for that king and said to him, " Prithee, send thou
for thy grooms. They have caught a thief in the mead of thy
home farm. Where have they put him ? " They brought the
grooms. Quoth he to them, " Where did ye put that thief whom
ye seized in the mead of the home farm ? " Said they, " Sire, we
made him over into the hands of our officer, the Master of the
Horse." They brought before him the Master of the Horse. They
said to him, " These grooms made over to thy custody a certain
thief. Where hast thou put him ? " But he denied that he had seen
him. Then the grooms gave testimony, " Sire, of a surety, we did
make him over to this man's custody." Then quoth the King â€”
the one who formerly had been dressed as a faqlr â€” " bring ye the
four executioners. They themselves will say what hamoened."

They brought them, and the King said to them, " Ye have in trust
a deposit made by that faqir, give ye it here and now." Then those
executioners dioVa deed. They brought forth those seven rubies
and laid them before the King. He took up four of them, and
gave them to them, as he said, " Who gave you these ? " Quoth
they, " A certain faqir." " And for what purpose ? " " This
Master of the Horse had made him over to us to be slain." Then
said the King to the Master of the Horse, " Dost thou not recognize
me ? It is I who am that faqir whom thou didst imprison. At
first came that lady to thee with a dish of dainty meats. Ye ate
together, and some scraps and orts remained over and above.
You gave a shout and called to me, ' Come, thou prisoner, eat thou
these scraps and orts of ours.' So I came and took and ate.
After that you clipped and toyed together, till the joint of the bed
became broken. You gave a shout and called to me, ' Haply,
dost thou know how to mend this bed ? ' and I replied to you,
* Yea, why should I not know ? My neighbours are carpenters/
I mended for you the bed, and my wife saw that it was I. Said she
to thee, ' This is my husband, he must be killed this very night
of nights.' Thou gavest me into the hands of these executioners,
and to them came compassion for me, and they let me go free. I
gave them seven rubies. Four gave I, one for each of the four,
and three I left with them in deposit for me. Now, here I have
these three rubies, and four have I just now given to these four men.
There, in their hands, are they also for thee to see." And in this
way was his guilt proved against him.

13. And moreover my Master told me : â€”

He gave the order to his army. He dragged forth the Master of
the Horse and his own wife. He had dug a pit and had them both
cast into it, and had them stoned with stones until they died. On
this subject verily a master of books hath written : â€”

Treacherous are a knife, a serpent, and the coquetry of a woman.

14. Thenceforth went again the King and came again to
Raja Vikramaditya's palace. Then gave they the news to the Raja,
" A king hath come and asketh for his wife." Then said the Raja,

" Of a faqlr she is the wife, not of a king." Quoth the King to him,
" Verily, I am no other than that faqir. I have with me thy token,
and thou hast with thee mine." Quoth the Raja to him, " What
meant the faqirhood of those days, and what meaneth the royalty
of to-day ? " Said the King to him, " I had bought five things,
and them was I testing, and therefore dressed I myself as a faqlr."
Then the Raja did a deed. He gave the King his wife to be with him.
The King went forth and came to his own city, and there he swayed
the sceptre of his rule. This is the end, and may peace and honour

XI. THE SONG OF FORSYTH SAHIB WHEN HE WENT
TO CONQUER YARKAND.

The Mission of Sir Douglas Forsyth across the Hindukush to
Kashgar took place in 1873-4. It passed through Kashmir, where
people were collected to serve in the camp. Sdbir, the author of this
poem, describes the events attending the impressment of these camp-
followers. He evidently believes that it was a military expedition
to conquer Yarkand.

1. What I have seen, to that attend and thou shalt hear.
" Yarkand will we conquer for ourselves."

2. First, said the Queen of England, " Who can do this work ?
A mighty man is Forsyth." To him she gave the order, " Seat
thyself upon the throne of Yarkand as its king, and from it levy
thou tribute. Yarkand will we conquer for ourselves."

3. They who wielded the sceptre of authority from London
unto Yarkand became famous over all the world. First halted they
in Sonamarg 1 to enjoy the delight of the flower-meads. " Yarkand
will we conquer for ourselves."

4. Ahead went the order of the Maharaj of Kashmir to Tibet. 2
" Ye Baltis, advance ye and then hasten ye to Kashmir bringing
passports with ye. Yarkand will we conquer for ourselves."

5. The order for their assembling issued forth on all sides, and
at first the people were collected in Maraz. 3 Lamenting were they
and crying " Poor ignorant souls, whither are we come ? " " Yarkand
will we conquer for ourselves."

6. In houses of these Tibetans were Kashmiris quartered, and
the brothers of Tibet were sent forward in advance. Horses were
stationed for the post, and yaks for collecting and piling grass.
" Yarkand will we conquer for ourselves."

1 A celebrated upland in the Sindh Valley of Kashmir, famous for the
beauty of its wild flowers.

2 i.e. Little Tibet or Baltistan. The people of this country are excellent
carriers. They are represented as being despatched in droves to the
rendezvous in Kashmir. They are furnished with passports or certificates of
dispatch.

3 One of the two divisions â€” Maraz and Kamraz â€” of the Valley of Kashmir.
Maraz is the southern part of the valley, on both sides of the River V6th above
Srlnagar.

7. Women were collected to help in distributing straw and fire-
wood. Some of them were fresh from childbed, and others were
heavy with child. " Yarkand will we conquer for ourselves."

8. Horses were demanded from villages that had naught but
fowls. Their drivers knew not how to say "tchk", and could say
only "har 1 har 1 '," l as they urged them along. "Yarkand will we
conquer for ourselves. "

9. When they harnessed a horse they turned the crupper towards
its head, and hung the bridle by its tail. Grass ropes did they use
for strong binding-straps. 2 All the appliances that they had were
pack-saddles 3 of straw and saddles made of rags. " Yarkand will
we conquer for ourselves."

10. Menial cultivators were impressed in proportion to the size
of each village, and on the shoulder of each was laid the burden of
some special duty. Like bundles of grass were they crowded
together, as they carried cooking pots for the potters. " Yarkand
will we conquer for ourselves."

11. Said the potter's wife to the potter, " potter, thou art
a fool. What need have we to put pots into the kiln ? The business,
dear, is a travelling one, and we must leave all uncooked food
behind us (and bring with us our food ready cooked)." " Yarkand
will we conquer for ourselves."

12. Said the cow-herd to his wife, " Let us both go forth and
arrange a place for the cows. If we carry a wisp of grass upon our
heads, the cows will follow at a run." " Yarkand will we conquer
for ourselves."

13. He went forth, milk-pail on haunch, and carrying his load
of pots. The people all were exhausted by their march, and to
them the kindly milkman seemed as blessed as a garden-watcher
of Paradise. " Yarkand will we conquer for ourselves."

1 "Tchk " is the click made to encourage a horse, "har 1 har 1 " is what is said
for the same purpose to a cow. The impressed drivers were unaccustomed
to horses, and knew only the bovine expletive.

1 The kaiiMkh is the term used for the two straps or ropes attached at the
back of a Kashmiri saddle to secure blankets, etc. (Stein).

3 The gand 1 is the term used for the Turkistan pack-saddle, which consists of
two straw-filled pommels joined in front (Stein).

14. The sweeper said to the sweeper's wife, " I shall never
remember what I have to do. They expect me to provide leather
and a cobbler's laces. They are sending me off, my dear, with a
leather-cutter and a cobbler's awl." " Yarkand will we conquer
for ourselves."

15. And she replied, " Thou shouldst have answered them,
pimp of a sweeper. 1 Thou shouldst have said, ' I know not how
to use them.' ' "I did, my sweeperess, say that to them, but they
heard me not at all." " Yarkand will we conquer for ourselves."

16. The roll-call was cried for the artisans, and a demand was
made for workers in iron. Each came bearing his anvil on his head,
and leaning on his tongs as if they were a stick. " Yarkand will we
conquer for ourselves."

17. The blacksmiths grumbled and complained, " Where are we
to look for coals ? How can we aright arrange our smithy ? " But
somehow or other the officials made a makeshift for them, and set
them a -forging horseshoes. "Yarkand will we conquer for
ourselves."

18. Very pleased did I become, and mighty good it seemed to
me that last of all they impressed the barber and the carpenter
(of my village), and that I saw them running after the others each
with a kerchief of food in his hand. 2 " Yarkand will we conquer
for ourselves."

19. Their wives are holding a conference with each other. Say
they, " Who is, then, now to support the barber's wife and the
carpenter's wife ? We shall have to earn our livelihood by hiring
ourselves out for spinning thread." " Yarkand will we conquer for
ourselves."

20. Sabir Oilman 3 only so much say, so long as they shall pay
heed unto the news. At length came the Sahib with all his retinue,
saying, " Yarkand will we conquer for ourselves."

1 This is really a term of affection, much as we sometimes use abusive words
in an affectionate sense, or talk of a "poor devil " in the language of pity.

2 A thoroughly Kashmiri sentiment, quite in keeping, with the villager's
indifference to the troubles of others. The author was evidently on bad terms
with the barber and carpenter of his village (Stein).

XII. THE TALE OF THE AKHUN.

1. There was once upon a time an Akhun, 1 who had four sons.
One day he said to them. " I am now grown old, tell me therefore
what professions you intend to follow." Said one, "I'll be a
prayer-leader in a mosque." Said another, "I'll call the people
to prayer." Said another, " I'll preach sermons." But the fourth
and youngest said, " I'll be a thief." So one day he went or! to
the King's palace to steal something. As he stood outside it there
came forth the Vizier and the King's daughter. When they saw
him standing there he asked them who they were. " And who art
thou ? " said they. " I'm a thief," said he. " So are we," said
they. Now they had brought out with them two horses, and he
straightway mounted on one of them, while the princess got on the
other. Then the Vizier said to him, "Go ye two in advance, and,
sir, pay thou heed to this one piece of instruction â€” thou shalt
not hold any love-talk with the princess. I will join you later on,
but go ye two in advance."

2. So they went on, the princess thinking all the time that it
was the Vizier, not the young Akhun, who was with her. By
and by dawn began to blossom forth, and they dismounted by a
stream, and to this went the princess and washed her face and hands.
Her eye fell on a ruby lying in the stream. She picked it up and
took it to the young Akhun, whom all the time she thought to
be the Vizier, though it was not him at all. Then, as the dawn
blossomed forth, the ruby emitted a brilliant light, and she saw
for the first time that it was not the Vizier. So she kept the ruby
to herself, and went on with him till they came to a certain city.
There they found a small hut in which they made their lodging.

3. The young Akhun went to the King of that city, and asked
him for employment. " What canst thou do ? " asked the King.
" I know how to look after horses," answered he. Now, even
while they were yet speaking, there came a certain jeweller to sell
precious stones to the King. He had two rubies with him. Then

-4] XII. THE TALE OF THE AKHUN 87

the young Akhun, who now called himself a groom, up and said,
" Your Majesty, one of these rubies is beyond price, but the other
hath a flaw in it in the shape of a worm." The King asked him
how he knew this. Said he in answer, " Sire, of a surety there is
a worm inside it. Break it and see. If no worm then come forth
from it, do unto me whatsoever your Majesty may please. But
if a worm do come forth, I shall deserve a present."

4. Quoth my master : â€”

They broke the ruby into pieces, and sure enough a worm issued
forth from it ; and from that time they gave him the title of " Royal
Lapidary " instead of that of " Groom ". So the Lapidary returned
home, and the days passed. By night he stayed at home, and each
day he attended court to examine rubies. The King's barber
came one day to shave him, and there he saw the princess, who
passed as the Lapidary's wife. Now she was very fair to look upon,
and the barber went off on his rounds to shave the King's Vizier.
" Said he, Vizier, that Lapidary hath a wife, and she would
verily adorn the mansion of a Vizier. Thou shouldst find him
guilty of some failure in his duty." Quoth the Vizier, " Willingly,
and why not ? " and went off to the King's daughter. He told
her to tell the King that she wanted another ruby just like the one
that the Lapidary had first of all approved as beyond price. So
she went to her father and quoth she, " Fain would I have another
ruby beyond price, like unto the first." When the Lapidary came
that day to the presence the King said to him, " Bring thou me
another ruby like unto that one." The Lapidary returned home,
and sat down there in silent consternation. Said the woman to
him, " Why art thou so anxious ? " Replied he, " The King
demandeth from me a ruby beyond price, and where am I to find
it ? " Said she, " Go thou and say to the King, ' If thou wilt give
me a month's expenses, I will bring thee the ruby.' " Well, the
King gave him expenses sufficient for a month, and he brought
the money home. There he stayed eating his food, not going to

court or anywhere else. When a month had passed the woman
gave him the ruby she had picked up out of the stream, and,
taking it to the King, he laid it before him with a bow.

5. The Lapidary then left the court and returned home, where
he passed the night. Next morning the barber came to shave him.
When he had finished he went off to the Vizier. Said he, " Prithee,
do somewhat unto that Lapidary. His wife is very beautiful.
She would verily adorn the mansion of a Vizier." So the Vizier
went again to the King's daughter and told her to ask the King
for a ruby necklace. Quoth she to her father, " Fain would I have
a ruby necklace." In due course the Lapidary came to the presence
and made his bow. Said the King, " Sir, thou must bring unto me
a number of rubies sufficient for a necklace." He went home, and
the woman whispered to him, " Why art thou sitting here ? "
Replied he, " To-day the King demandeth from me a ruby necklace.
Whence can I bring one 1 " Quoth she to him, " Thou needst
not be anxious in the least. Go and take three months' expenses
from the King." The King gave him the money and he returned
to his house.

6. So there he stayed eating and drinking till the three
months were passed. Then the woman said to him. " Thou knowest
the stream from whence I picked up that ruby. Go thou up it
a little way, and thou wilt come to a spring. Thou must dig a
pit close to the source of the spring, and hide thyself therein.
At first six females will come to bathe in the spring. Do thou
nothing unto them ; but afterwards thou wilt see coming the eldest
sister of these six. She also will go down into the spring to bathe.

She will doff her clothes and leave them on the bank. Thou must
then go secretly and carry off her garments."

7. The six females came and did their bathing, but to them
said he nothing. Afterwards there came the seventh female.
She doffed her clothes, and leaving them on the bank descended
into the spring. He came secretly and carried off her garments
and hid himself again in the pit. When she had finished her
bath she went up again on to the bank, and saw that her
garments were no longer there. She uttered a loud cry, saying,
" Be thou demon or be thou human being, I make to thee an
oath by the God who created thee. Put not thou my secret parts
to shame, and whate'er thou ask will I give to thee." He then
called to her from the pit, "Swear thou to me by God that thou wilt
hear and agree to whatsoe'er I shall demand from thee." When
she had sworn by God he gave her her garments, and she put them
on. Then quoth she, " What is thy command ? " and the Lapidary
replied, " Thou must come with me." So they went along, the
Lapidary in front, and the fairy following behind.

8. Saith my Master :â€”

Her name was Lalmal, the Fairy, and they came to the Lapidary's
house.

9. And moreover saith my Master : â€”

I know not which it was, but either at every word she spoke a
ruby dropped, or else seven rubies fell each day from her mouth.
The night came to an end and dawn appeared. The Lapidary
picked up seven rubies and carried them off to the King. Making
his bow he laid the seven rubies before him, and mighty pleased
became the King.

10. The Lapidary took his leave from the presence and returned
home. In due course came the barber and shaved him. When
he had finished the barber went off to the Vizier and shaved him
also. Said he, " Vizier, a second wife hath now appeared for
that Lapidary. She is very fair to look upon, much more fair even
than the first. Prithee do somewhat to him. One of the wives

is fit for a Vizier, and the other would suit me." Replied the Vizier,
" I must, sir, again speak to the King's daughter." So he went and
said to her, " Thou shouldst ask of thy father a jewelled bracelet."
So the princess went to her father and quoth she to him, " Fain
would I have a jewelled bracelet." On the morrow came the
Lapidary to the presence, and to him said the King, " Bring me,
sir, a jewelled bracelet."

11. The Lapidary went forth and came to his home. Said he
to the two women, " The King demandeth of me a jewelled bracelet.
Whence am I to bring it ? " Then up and said to him Lalmal,
the fairy, Go thou and ask the King for three months' expenses."
The King gave the money to him, and he returned with it to his
house. Each day passed day by day, and the three months became
completed. Then Lalmal the Fairy took a paper and wrote upon
it. Quoth she to the Lapidary, " Go thou to the spring from which
thou hast brought me, and therein cast this paper. Then from the
spring a hand will rise, and on it will be a jewelled bracelet. Take
hold of it, but descend thou not into the spring."

12. So he went off, taking the paper with him. He flung it into
the spring, and even as he did so a hand wearing a jewelled bracelet
rose from the water. He grasped hold of the hand, but did so with
such force that he pulled the forearm off, and went off home with
it and with the bracelet. The night came to an end and at dawn
he went to the King. Making his bow he laid the bracelet before
him, and mighty pleased became the King.

13. The Lapidary took his leave from the presence and returned
home. Again came the barber and shaved him. When he had
finished his job he went straight to the Vizier, and again addressed
him, " Vizier, thou dost not in any way get at that Lapidary.
Prithee, do thou something to him." The Vizier went to the King's

daughter, and quoth he, " Thou art a King's daughter, shouldst
thou have but one bracelet ? Yet another shouldst thou ask of the
King ? " So she departed. Quoth she to her father, " Fain would
I have yet another bracelet." Again came the Lapidary to the
presence, and to him said the King, " Thou must bring unto me
another bracelet."

14. The Lapidary took his leave and came to his own house.
Said he to these two women, " To-day doth the King demand of
me another jewelled bracelet." Then Lalmal the Fairy gave him
her own ring. Quoth she, " Go thou again unto the spring. Close
by one side of it thou wilt find a great rock. Show thou my ring
unto that rock, and it will arise and stand upright. Thou wilt
find a pathway opening at its foot. Descend thou underground
by the path and thou wilt find my crony-girl. She will give to thee
a jewelled bracelet."

15. The Lapidary went forth and reached the spot. He showed
the ring to the rock and it arose and stood upright. Down the path
he went beneath the ground, and, deep down below, he saw a certain
lady sitting all alone. Quoth she to him, " Whence comest thou ? "
Saith he, " Lalmal the Fairy asketh of thee a jewelled bracelet."
Then memory came to the lady. It was her mother whose forearm
had been pulled off together with the former jewelled bracelet,
and who now had but one arm. For that cause cherished the mother
wrath within her heart. So the lady thought to herself, " So soon
as my mother cometh she will devour this man." Now he was a
mighty personable fellow, and her heart was filled with anxiety
on his account, for she had determined to herself to marry him.
Just then her mother's footsteps became audible, and the place
was shaken by an earthquake. Thereupon the lady uttered a spell
over him. She turned him into a pebble, and put it into her pocket.
Then came to her her mother, " Aha ! my girl," cried she, " I
smell the smell of a mortal man." But the lady refused to admit
that he had been there. When at last her mother pressed her sore,
she said, " There is indeed a man. But first swear thou to me by
God that naught wilt thou do unto him." So the mother swore
to her by God, and she drew forth the pebble from her pocket,
and uttered a spell over it, so that it became a man exactly as he

had been before. Quoth she to her mother, " This is he who is
unto me as God. For him, and only for him, have I been seeking.
It is he, and he alone, mother, whom God hath sent unto me."
Then said her mother, " Good. So let it be. Send thou a letter by
his hand unto thy two brethren." Quoth she, " My mother, let it
be thou that writest." So the mother wrote a letter, and gave it
into the hand of the Lapidary. But the lady called him to her,
and asked him to give her the paper. She looked at it, and on it
by her mother were written these words, "If ye be indeed my sons,
on the instant that he cometh to you, must ye kill this man."
The mother had written this because she still bore in her heart
the memory of the pain of her lost forearm. But the lady tore the
paper into little pieces, and wrote herself another, " If ye be indeed
my brethren, quickly must ye come. And for why ? Because it
is my wedding festival."

16. She wrote for him the paper, and by word of mouth gave she
him this instruction, saying, " When thou shalt arrive thither,
make thou first a bow, and having louted low, give thou to them
this paper. They will offer thee dinner made of leathern pease,
but these thou must not eat." As a substitute she gave him real
pease to take with him, and said, " These be what thou must eat.
Drop thou their leathern pease into the fold of thy breast-cloth
and eat thine own pease in their stead. Thereafter they will ask
thee to give them a little scratching." For that purpose she gave
him a set of iron claws, " For," said she, " they are of a demon
race, and these iron claws will give them but a pleasant titillation."

17. Bearing these instructions in his memory he set forth, and
reached their abode. He made his bow to them and gave to them
the paper. They offered him a dinner of leathern pease. He raised
a gobbet of it to his mouth, but let it fall into the fold of his breast-
cloth, while at the same time he took out his own pease and kept
eating them. Thereafter they asked him to give them a little
scratching. So he secretly donned the iron claws and with them
scraped and scratched them. Then wrote they an answer to the
letter after this manner. " We have no time to come unto thee,
for we have been summoned by the holy Solomon. Haste ye, in the
name of God, and make ye the wedding festival."

18. He returned to the lady and her mother, and showed them
the reply. They read it and carried out the wedding between him
and her. Then said the lady to him who was now her husband,
" Here wilt thou stay, or wilt thou return unto the world of men ?
Behold I am thy humble slave." So he said that he would return
to the world of men, and quoth the lady to him, " Now, when we
shall set forth, my mother will tell thee to ask of her a gift. And
thou must ask for but one thing, a certain skin mat. Ask thou for
it alone, and for naught else." So, as they were preparing for their
journey her mother said to him, " Ask thou of me some gift,"
and he said to her " Give me the skin mat that is called the wutsha
prang, or ' flying-couch '." Well, they went forth from there and
reached his home. As soon as they arrived she made ready for
him a jewelled bracelet, and the Lapidary took it to the King.



19. The barber heard that the Lapidary had come home, and
goes to his house to shave him. There sees he the third lady, and
straight returns he to the Vizier. Said he to him, " Vizier, to-day
that Lapidary hath a third lady, more fair to look upon than the
other two. She is fit for the King. Another is fit for a Vizier, and
yet another would suit me. Prithee, do thou somewhat to this
Lapidary." Quoth the Vizier to him, " To-day will I tell the King,
and His Majesty himself will lay some trap for him. Then he will
die, and the three women will be ours." So the Vizier said to the
King, " Your Majesty, that Lapidary hath women three, and women
like unto them are not in the whole kingdom. Sire, prithee, seize
thou upon some fault of this Lapidary, and destroy him. Then
will the three women become inmates of thy harem." The King
considered a while and said, " No matter what thou mayst ask of
him, that all and sundry doth he bring. Now will I say unto him,
" Thou must bring me news of my father, whether he be in heaven
or whether he be in hell."

20. And saith my Master : â€”

The Lapidary came to the King and made his bow. Quoth the
King to him, " Hitherto hast thou hearkened unto whatsoever
command I gave to thee. To-day must thou bring unto me news
of my father, whether he be in heaven or whether he be in hell."
The Lapidary departed and came to his own house. Quoth he to
these three women, " To-day the King telleth me to bring news of
his father. What am I to do ? How know I even how many years
have passed since he hath died ? " Then up and spake the lady
who had made the jewelled bracelet (now she was a fairy who was
obedient unto God), " Let nothing prey upon thy mind. Go thou,
and ask of him expenses. Then say thou to the King, ' Thou must
gather together for me firewood. In the plain let there be gathered
together bundles of fuel beyond count.' "

21. The King assembled and piled firewood beyond count, and
the Lapidary ascended thereon. He spread upon it the skin mat,
and thereon he took his seat. Quoth he to the King, " What token
from thy father shall I bring ? " and up and said the King, " First
must thou bring unto me a fruit from the garden of paradise, and
secondly must thou bring unto me a letter signed by my father. "
Said the Lapidary to the people standing round, " Set ye the fire-
wood alight on all four sides."

22. And moreover saith my Master : â€”

When they had set the pyre alight, the Lapidary could no longer
be seen for fire and smoke. He uttered a charm to the skin mat,
saying, " I would arrive at mine own house, but have a care that
no one see it." He closed his eyes, and when he opened them he
found himself at home. Then that lady did a deed. Of the seven
metals l she prepared a fruit, a pomegranate of the Garden of
Heaven, and moreover she wrote a letter to which she put the
signature of the King's father, and sealed it with his seal. And
this was what she wrote to the King : " Thou must come unto me

extinct, leaving naught but ashes. The Lapidary went forth wearing
only his loin-cloth, and rolled himself in these ashes. The discerners
then discerned, and the newsmen brought the news. Cried they,
" Your Majesty, there cometh a sound as of rustling from the
ashes. Can it be that the Lapidary is returned ? " And while they
were yet speaking these words and gazing towards the pyre, there
came forth from it the Lapidary, in the one hand holding a pome-
granate, and in the other the letter. Having made his bow to the
King, he laid the pomegranate and the letter before him. The King
opened the letter and read it, and this was its contents, "I, of a
truth, am in heaven. Thou must come hither speedily, with thy
Vizier and with thy barber."

24. The King considered awhile, " I said unto myself that this
Lapidary would come to destruction, and, lo, he hath come to me
with news from my father." Quoth he to the Lapidary, " How can
I convey myself to that abode of bliss ? " Replied the Lapidary,
" Thou must gather together three times so much firewood as thou
didst gather for me, and then speedily wilt thou arrive in heaven."
The King gathered together fuel beyond count. Upon it he made
them spread a mat, and upon it he ascended and sat, himself with
the Vizier and the barber. They set the pyre alight on all four
sides.

25. And my Master saith : â€”

Burnt up was the King, burnt up was the Vizier, and burnt up
was the barber. The three became utterly destroyed. And from
his home came to the Lapidary's house that first Vizier, the one who
had been eloping with the princess when he met the young Akhun.
Together held they mutual converse, and the Lapidary told him
of his journey, and of all the villainy that the Vizier and the barber

her he kept with him as his wife.

The Vizier ascended the vacant throne and ruled right royally,

1 The meaning of the line is unknown. Hatim gives it as what he has
learnt by tradition. As regard zasanuy, informants in Srlnagar tell me that
it is not a Kashmiri word. Hatim says that it is an " old " word which is
unintelligible to him. The Srlnagar version is : â€”

"Wanay, *yiy zan, banda, monzur tee asunuy,'

" I-would-say- ' this know, slave, accepted by- it-is-to-be,'

to-thee thee

which is intelligible.

VOCABULARY OF ALL THE WORDS IN
GOVINDA KAULAS TEXT

[Roman numerals refer to the number of the story, and Arabic
numerals to the section. To save space, when several Arabic
numerals come together, tens are generally not repeated. Thus, xii,
21, 6, means xii, 21, 26. The order of words is based on the
alphabetical order of the consonants, without any regard to the vowels.
The latter come into consideration only in cases in which the same
consonant or consonants are followed or separated by different vowels.
Thus, the different words containing the consonants kn will be found
in the succession kan, kan 1 , kani, kina, kona, kun, kuni, and kun u .
All words beginning with vowels are arranged together at the com-
mencement of the Vocabulary, their mutual order being determined
by their consonants. The letter n follows n, and ts follows t. For
purposes of alphabetical order v and w are counted as the same letter.
In other respects the alphabetical order is that of the English
alphabet.']

It will be observed that when emph. y is added to yih,
the word takes several varying forms. As occurring in these
tales they are as follows : yihuy (an. m. and inan.), yihay
(an. f.), yihoy (inan.), yuhuy (an. m.), yohay (an. m.), yuhay
(inan.), yiy (inan.), yiy (inan.), y% (inan.).
yih 2, pron. rel. who, which, what. In construction, the antecedent
clause as a rule contains a demonstrative or other pronoun
as correlative, but in the following cases there is no correlative
pronoun : â€”

(a) Eelative clause preceding antecedent clause, ii, 9 ;
xi, 3, 8.

(b) Antecedent clause preceding relative clause, v, 7.
When there is a correlative pronoun it is most usually

some form of the demonstrative pronoun tih, q.v., as in â€”
(a) Eelative clause preceding antecedent clause, ii, 4, 7,

8 (bis), 11 ; iii, 1, 8 (ter) ; v, 8, 9 ; vi, 16 ; vii, 1, 29 ; viii, 6,

v, 5 ; vii, 8, 29, 30 ; x, 1, 6, 10, 2 ; xii, 4, 7, 11, 5, 25.

Or the correlative pronoun may be some form of yih 1,
as in (in every case the antecedent clause preceding), x, 5 ;
xii, 20, 5.

Or it may be some form of the pronoun ath, as in (antecedent
clause in each case preceding), ii, 9 ; vi, 14 ; x, 7.



411 VOCABULARY yih 2

In vi, 14, the antecedent is the genitive of the interrogative
pronoun kydh, i.e. kamyuk u , of what ?

Sometimes the correlative pronoun is used twice, once
immediately after the relative, and again in the antecedent
clause, which in this, case follows the relative clause. The
repeated correlative is not necessarily the same as the one
after the relative pronoun. Thus, yus suh iota 6s u , yuh 6s u
phakiras nishe, who he (i.e. he who) was the parrot, he was
with the faqir, ii, 9 ; so yus yiih wazir 6s u , suh chuh hdpatas-
manz, he who was the vizier, he is (now) in the bear, ii, 11 ;
yus yih pdtashdha-sond u mor u 6s u , yih trdwun, that which was
the body of the king, that he abandoned, ii, 10 ; yesa yih
Ldlmdl Pan os u , tas dyutun rukhsath, she who was the Fairy
Lalmal, to her he gave leave to depart, xii, 25 ; yesa yih fata
uil u n zinith, sa thov u n panas, she whom he had won and after-
wards brought home, her he kept for himself, xii, 25.

Like the demonstrative pronouns, the relative pronoun
has animate and inanimate forms, and either of these may be
substantival or adjectival. But in some cases in which we
should look upon the relative as a substantive it is treated
as an adjective. This is specially the case when the
antecedent correlative is an adjective. In such a case the
relative, even if not in direct agreement with a noun, also
takes the adjectival form. Thus, suh lal, yus tujydn, xii, 4,
that ruby which she had taken up. Here we have the in-
animate adjectival form yus, because the antecedent
correlative, suh, is an adjective. The inanimate substantival
form would be yih. Similarly, yih panun u saphar, yus
noyidan 6s u pesh on u rrwt u , this (yih) his suffering, which he
experienced at the hands of the barber, xii, 25.
