# DS in the classroom: creating a digital edition

For this session we will demonstrate a simple project using the skills you've been developing: building a simple website using GitHub pages. The 'theme' we'll be using is [Ed](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/), designed for textual editors who want to create a digital edition of a primary text using the principles of [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/). Because it's an easy way to collaborate on creating open educational resources, we'll talk about how one could assign a similar activity to students.

In this session, we will:

- clone (download) a GitHub repository
- prepare and publish a markdown document of a public domain text
- collaborate on a GitHub Pages website
- learn how to build a lightweight digital edition
