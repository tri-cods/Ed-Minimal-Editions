# Setting up

## Cloning our repository

For this project you'll need a local copy of this GitHub repository, which you will download or 'clone'. First, navigate to whichever directory you want to use to store this project.

`cd <your directory>`

Then use Git to download

`git clone https://github.com/tri-cods/Ed-Minimal-Editions.git`

You now have a copy of the 'Ed Minimal Edition repository' in your computer that you can contribute to.

## Working 'locally' in GitHub

## Choosing a text for your digital edition

You can use anything you want, but for the purposes of this workshop, we encourage you to pick something in the public domain that you're able to find in plain text format. For example, here's a list of [texts from the Internet Archive that entered the public domain in 2019](https://archive.org/details/texts?and%5B%5D=date%3A1923%2A&sort=-downloads).

Once you've selected your text, download it in plain text format (with the file extension .txt).


4. Save the text file as “your-own-title.md”
5. Move it to the "_texts" folder in your local copy of the Ed MinimalEditions repository
